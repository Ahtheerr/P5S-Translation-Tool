"Heh, come get some!"
"Aww yeah, here we go!"
Ready for an ass-kickin'!?
"Let's take 'em out!
Quick and clean!"
Aaall right! Let's go!
"Okay, time to go to work."
No way am I gonna lose!
No holding back!
You're all going down!
I will strike you down!
This fight is ours.
Let the battle begin.
Here we go!
"Full power, everyone!"
Please don't get in our way.
I'm ready!
Here I go!
I won't hold back!
"Initiating combat!
Stay sharp, people!"
Send 'em packing!
"Look alive, ladies!"
"They're in our way...
Let's move them aside."
"This fight is ours.
No hard feelings."
Make way for the Phantom Thieves!
"We're moving in.
Give them no quarter!"
"Step aside if you don't want to get
hurt."
Get the hell out of my way.
Ah crap...
Oh shit... Not good!
"Damn, they got us!"
How could I let this happen...?
"Crap, that was careless!"
What the—!?
What're we gonna do?
This is bad! This is really bad!
P-Please let us go!
Ngh! Oh no!
How careless of me!
Look out!
"Not good... Stay focused, everyone!"
How could we be so careless...
Don't lose your composure!
"Um... This is bad, right?"
"Be careful, okay?"
We're surrounded!?
"I think I should mention you're
surrounded!"
"Well that escalated quickly...
But we're just getting started!"
Bad news—we're surrounded!
Hm. This could be a problem.
This isn't good... We're surrounded.
Are we in trouble?
"Damn, they got the drop on us!"
I think we may have screwed up!
"We're in deep shit, aren't we?"
We got this for sure!
This oughta be good!
"Ohhh, you're screwed now!"
This oughta be easy.
Come on! Let's teach these guys a lesson!
"Hehehe, we've got 'em now!"
Are we lucky or what?
Ooh! Talk about lucky!
"What do you think?
Can we pull it off?"
We've taken them by surprise!
Now's our chance!
You're wide open!
Let's finish them off in one blow!
We'll breeze right past them!
"As long as we keep the advantage,
the battle is ours!"
Okay!
"Look, they're panicking!"
Now's our chance to attack!
This is our chance! Wipe 'em out!
Woohoo! Time for a royal beatdown!
"We have the upper hand!
Aim for complete victory!"
"Okay, let's finish them."
"Ooh, we're in a good spot!"
Looks like the enemy's panicking.
We will break them into pieces.
Let's tear right through them!
This is our chance! Don't waste it!
We'll mess 'em up in no time!
"Welp, let's get this done!"
Let's show 'em what we're made of!
They're gonna regret messing with us!
C'mon! Let's get 'em!
All right! Let's go!
Don't lower your guard.
All will fall to my blade.
Let's give it our all!
"Okay, here goes!"
I'll do my best!
"All right, give it your very best!"
"Go, go, go!"
Engaging the enemy!
"Okay, let's take them out."
Okay. Leave it to me.
"Right, let's go!"
"All right, time to get started!"
"No worries, we can handle it!"
"Hey, we'll get through it!"
No choice. We gotta find a way out!
Just stay calm! Don't lose focus!
"No time to think!
Let's just figure a way out!"
We'll be okay! Just stay calm!
"Fear not, I'll cut us a path!"
We can do it! Push them back!
"No need to panic, we can always
turn this around!"
"Everyone, stay calm! We'll just fight
our way through this!"
"Don't worry, everyone!
We can do this!"
It's okay. Try to stay calm.
"Too late to back down now!
Everyone, defense formation!"
Don't get frazzled! You can do this!
Don't worry. We can do this.
It'll be all right. Stay strong.
Just stay calm and don't panic!
We can handle this—just stay focused!
"Hell yeah, we got this!"
"Oh, we're gonna run right through
'em!"
"Great, let's do this!"
This'll be a piece of cake!
"We got this! C'mon, everyone!"
Hmph. This'll be easy!
Very well. Let's finish this quickly!
You won't escape!
Let's push on through!
Don't let your guard down!
Mhm! I'm sure we can win!
Let's make this quick!
"Okay, time to rack up some damage!"
Yeah! Let's steamroll these bozos!
Yes. This won't take long.
Right. Let's clear a path.
"All right, let 'em have it!"
Don't let up the assault!
You're done for!
Kiss your ass goodbye!
You won't know what hit ya!
Time to wrap it up!
Let's finish it!
Say your prayers!
Nice try!
This is it!
You're not getting away!
This is it! The final act!
This is the end!
We have them now!
Here's the finish!
This should end it!
It's over!
Time for the finale!
This is farewell!
This'll teach you!
You know what to do! Get crazy!
Now! Finish 'em off!
Bring on the mass destruction!
Take this!
This should do it!
Time to finish it!
We've got you now!
"Lights out, bastards."
"Begone, scumbags!"
"Yeah, you like that!?"
That blow your mind or what?
Yep... Nailed it! Mewhehehe!
It's not easy being this cool!
Woohoo! How's that for ya?
Hehe. Every rose has its thorns!
Heh. I'd say that went well!
"A splendid performance, if I do say so myself."
Never pull any punches!
I'd say that went well!
Yes! It worked!
That felt pretty good!
How was that?
Heheh!
And that'll do it.
"Not bad, if I do say so myself."
"Hey, they had it comin'."
"Heh, you can thank me later!"
"Heh, naturally."
Leave it to me!
How was that?
Keep 'em coming!
That was well played.
We're not done yet!
I'm not done yet!
Plenty more where that came from!
That went really well!
There's more where that came from!
Not done yet.
Perfect!
That's what I'm talking 'bout!
We're not done yet!
"Dammit, there's more!?"
"There's more on the way...
Don't let up, people!"
Ngh... We're not out yet!
They're still coming! Don't overdo it!
Huh!? There's more of them?
"Uh-oh... We're not done yet.
Maybe we should take it slow."
Ngh... Those wretches are still coming!
"Our foes are still great in number.
We'd be wise to conserve our strength."
"They're still swarming the area!
Pace yourselves!"
"Don't get exhausted! There are
still more foes to come! "
More Shadows... Here they come.
"There's quite a few Shadows left...
We probably shouldn't be too hasty."
"The enemies are at roughly 50%!
You pacing yourselves?"
"Mmm, still more Shadows ahead.
Don't go ballistic now."
There's still a lot of enemies...
"I'm still picking up a lot of enemies.
You might want to pace yourselves."
"Geez, there's no end to this!"
"Numbers are still on their side.
Act wisely now."
"All right, we took out most of 'em.
Don't let up, guys!"
"Finally, they let up...
Let's finish 'em off!"
Almost there! One last push!
We've got 'em now! Just keep it up!
Not many left! Just a little more!
Almost there! Let's get 'em!
"Only a few remain.
Let's finish them off!"
"That's it for the reinforcements.
Now, let us end this!"
"The end is almost in sight!
Only a few enemies left!"
"The battle's almost won!
Let's finish this!"
"Just a few more to go!
Let's show them what we can do!"
"We're almost there!
Stay strong, everyone!"
"They're running out of steam now.
Time to pull out all the stops!"
"They're on their last legs!
Don't let up!"
"I'm sensing less enemies.
Let's finish this."
The end is in sight. We can do it.
"Good, we're thinning their ranks.
Stay on the offensive!"
"They're running out of steam.
Hunt down any stragglers!"
"Whoa! Badass, Joker!"
"Whoa! Lookin' cool, Joker!"
"Wow, Joker! I knew you could do it!"
"Magnificent, Joker! We could all

"That was incredible, Joker!"

You're amazing!"
"Striking performance as always,
Mona! Truly excellent!"
"Wonderful, Mona! I mean it!"
"Wow! That was incredible, Mona-chan!"
"Nice one, Mona!

"Razzle-dazzle, baby!
Keep stylin', Panther!"
"Beautiful as always, Panther!

"Beautiful, Panther!
Perhaps I should paint you after all..."
"Nice work, Panther!
That's how you put on a show!"
"Ooh, Panther! You're a natural!"
"Panther, you had me mesmerized!
Too cool!"
"Great job, Panther! She's so graceful."

"I see you, Beauty Thief!"
"Noir, that was perfect! Way to go!"
"Gorgeous and refined as ever...
Well played, Noir."
"Beautiful, Noir!
You're a fighter par excellence!"

"That was incredible, Sophie!"
"Good job, Sophie! You got this!"
"Fine work, Sophie!
Your skills know no bounds!"

Gramps has a few tricks up his sleeve."
"Perfect form, Wolf!
Definitely something to emulate."
"Amazing, Wolf!

You're doing great!
Ooh! That was awesome!

Keep it up!
That's why you're the leader.
Perhaps I should be taking notes.
Well done!
"Great technique, Joker!"
You pulled that off quite well.
Simply astonishing.
"Good going, Joker!"
I know I can count on you!
Strong as always!
"Ooh! Real snazzy, Joker!"

"Nice one, Skull!"
Don't get carried away now!
"Good one, Skull!"

Most impressive.
A skillful display.
"Hammer away, Skull!"
Pound them into oblivion!
Not bad at all!
"Keep it up, Skull!"
"Skull, that was great!"
Yeah! Go get 'em!
"High five, Skull!"
Mmhm. I approve.
That's the stuff!
"Very nice, Skull."
That one was really cool.
"Skull can be pretty cool every now
and then."
"Attaboy, Skull!"
"Hey, not bad."
"Don't let it get to your head, now."
"Good stuff, Mona!"
Not bad at all!
That was intense!
Mhm. I'd expect nothing less!
We can't all be this smooth!
Sometimes I impress even myself!
"Go, Mona, go!"
"Good job, Mona!"
Yeaaah! You can do it!
"Ferocious, to say the least."
Oh?
"Fantastic, Mona."
"Just like that, Mona!"
"Keep it up, Mona!"
I knew you'd pull it off!
"Ooh! Great job, Mona-chan!"
That attack was amazing!
"Go, Mona-chan, go!"
"Nice one, Mona!"

Color me impressed.
You really can fight.

Sucks to be them.
"Daaang, you're on fire!"

Such exquisite technique.
Truly picturesque.
"Well done. Remarkable, really."

"Wow, way to go!"
You sure can dish it out!
"Oooh. Way to go, Fox!"
"Go, go, gooo!"
Nice one!
"I must say, that couldn't have gone
better."
That went rather well.
I suppose that'll do.
"You're weaving through them like
water!"
"No hesitation, Fox!"
Might as well leave the rest to you!
"Great work, Fox!"
"Ooh, nice one!"
Keep up the good work!
"I saw that, Inari!"
That was pure art!
"Hack and slash, Inari!"
"Ooh, good one."
"Good job, Fox!"
"Wow, Fox is cool too!"
"Not bad, Fox!"
Beautiful swordplay.
Look at you go.
Don't go messin' with Queen...
"Whoa, brutal!"
Not a bad way to do it!
"That's our Queen, all right..."
Keep on 'em!
I feel sorry for these guys!
"Work it, Queen!"
"Wow, she's amazing..."
I gotta keep up!
"Wonderful, Queen."
Can't say I'm surprised...
"It's times like these I'm glad we're on
your side..."
I imagine that hurt.
I'm just getting warmed up!
"One down, more to go!"
"Queen, that was incredible..."
Such a graceful strike!
Nice one! We're counting on you!
"Ooh, bet they felt that one."
That was like a megaton explosion!
"Queen, you totally rock!"
"That was amazing, Queen."
"Excellent job, Queen!"
I want to be just like her.
"Great work, Queen!"
She's quite the powerhouse...
Nice hit!
"Knock 'em out, Noir!"

Such intensity...
"You're doing great, Noir!"
"Keep up the fight, Noir!"
Great job!
I know that one hurt!
I think that went quite well!
Don't lose focus!
"Take it away, Beauty Thief!"
That axe looks painful...
"Just like that, Noir!"
"Nice one, Noir."

"You're on a roll, Sophie!"
No holds barred!

"Raise some hell, Sophie!"
Keep up the pressure!

"Yep, that should do it."
"Okay, I'm going in! Watch my back,

"Commencing hack! Keep the bad
guys at bay!"
I'm in trouble! Someone help!
"Wah! My HP's in the red!

This is bad! Heal please!
Sorry... I've reached my limit...
Gyaaah! This is pure agonyyy!

"Even I'm being thrown for a loop...
But the challenge has just begun!"
"Hey, now we're gettin' somewhere!
Just keep holding 'em off!"
"Nyehehe, cracked it like an egg!
Not much longer now!"
"Ladies and gentlemen, your hack is
now complete! Been a pleasure!"
"Aaaand voila! Thanks for the

"Are you guys all right!?
You'd better heal yourselves!"

Hurry up and heal!"
"You guys've used up a lot of stamina.
Don't get careless."

"Panther's low on stamina!
Make sure to cover her!"
"Fox, your stamina's pretty low.
Try not to push yourself!"

"Sophie, is your stamina all right?
Don't overexert yourself!"
"Wolf doesn't have much stamina left!
Careful moving forward."
"Your stamina's low.
Be sure to keep an eye on it."
"You guys've burned a lot of stamina...
Don't overdo it, okay!?"
"Joker, you're low on stamina!
Be careful!"
"Skull, stop charging ahead!
You don't have the stamina
for that!"
"Mona's running out of stamina!
Spend it wisely!"
"Panther's almost all out of
stamina! Somebody help her!"
"Fox, you don't have much
stamina left! Conserve it!"
"Watch out, Queen!
Your stamina's almost gone!"
"Noir's spent most of her stamina!
Better keep an eye on her!"
"Sophie's stamina is running low!
She needs to recharge!"

His health is going down!"
"Queen's been set on fire!
S-Someone put her out!"
"Noir's burning up quick!
Do something or she's a goner!"
"Sophie's erupting in flames!
Put her out quick!"
"I can hear the flames crackling!
Someone save Wolf!"
"You're burning up! You'll lose
health if you stay like that!"
Oh no! Joker's frozen solid!
Crap! Skull's been frozen!
I... can't... move...
Ah! Panther's frozen!
Wha—!? Fox has been frozen!
Queen was frozen!
"Noir's been frozen!
She needs our help!"
Oh no! Sophie's been frozen!
Heads up! Wolf's been frozen!
"They're frozen!
They can't move like this!"
Wah! Joker's been frozen!
"Uh-oh, we got a frozen Skull
here!"
"Mona's frozen solid!
He can't move!"
Panther's frozen! Not good!
"Whoa, we got Fox on the rocks!"
"Oh no, Queen's been frozen!"
Bad news! Noir's on ice!
"Whoa, they froze Sophie solid!"
Wolf's like a big ice cube!
"You got a frozen teammate on your
hands! They won't be able to move!"
"Not good. Joker's been shocked!
He won't be able to move if we
don't help him out!"
Skull's been shocked! He can't move!
I f-feel... t-t-tingly... C-Can't... move!
"Panther's been shocked!
She can't move like that!"
"Fox was shocked!
He can't move till he recovers!"
"Queen's been shocked! She won't

"Noir's been shocked! She can't
move until the effect wears off!"
"Sophie's been shocked!
She won't be able to move!"
"Wolf's been shocked!
He can't move till it goes away!"
"They've been shocked!
They won't be able to move!"
"Joker's shocked! His movement will
be slowed till it clears up!"
"Skull's been shocked! That'll screw
up his movement big-time!"
"Mona's shocked! His movement is
severely impacted!"
"Panther's shocked! Fix it, or she
won't move right!"
"Fox is shocked. He can't move well
till we cure it!"
"Queen is shocked! Her movement's
restricted right now!"
"Noir is shocked! She can't move
normally like this! "
"Sophie's shocked! Her movements
are compromised!"
"Wolf's been shocked. His movements

Ngh... I'm dizzy. I can't see!
"Panther's dizzy!

They can't see like this!"
"Oh no, Joker's dizzy!
Can you see!?"
"Skull's dizzy! He can't see
his surroundings!"
"Mona's dizzy! Hey, what do you see?"
"Panther's dizzy and can't see
well... Might wanna fix that!"
"Fox is dizzy! I don't think he can see
too well!"
"Queen's dizzy! She can't see
her surroundings!"
"Noir got dizzy! She can't see
her surroundings!"
"Sophie was dizzied! She doesn't
know what's around her!"
"Wolf's dizzy! He's just stumbling
around!"
"You're dizzy!? Oh no...
Okay, don't look—feel!"
"Joker's forgotten his abilities!
He can't use his Persona!"
"Skull's forgotten his Persona!
He needs help!"
Wha...? Persona? What's a Persona?
"Panther's forgotten her Persona!
It's been sealed!"
"Fox forgot his Persona!
It's been sealed!"
"Queen's forgotten her abilities!
She can't use her Persona!"
"Noir's become forgetful!
Her Persona's been sealed!"
"Sophie's become forgetful!
She can't remember her skills!"
"Wolf's forgotten his abilities!
He can't use his Persona!"
"They've been hit with Forget!
Their Persona's been sealed!"
"Joker forgot how to use Personas!
He's locked out of all his skills!"
"Skull's being forgetful—that means
his Persona's been sealed!"
"Mona's acting forgetful! He can't
use his Persona like this!"
"Panther forgot how to summon her
Persona! She's can't use any skills!"
"Fox is acting forgetful! His Persona
won't come out at all!"
"Queen forgot how to bring out her
Persona! Now she can't use skills!"
"Noir suddenly forgot her Persona!
Someone snap her out of it!"
"Sophie's been hit with forgetfulness!
She can't use any skills!"
"Wolf, you forgot your Persona!?
How are you supposed to fight now!?"
"Crap! If you forget your Persona,
you can't use any skills!"
"Oh no! Joker fell asleep!
Wake up, Joker!"
"Hey, wake up, Skull!
You're gonna get hurt!"
So... sleepy... Good night.
"Ah! Panther's asleep!
Panther, wake up!"
Huh!? Fox is asleep!
This is bad! Queen fell asleep!
Noir's asleep! Someone wake her up!
"What!? Sophie fell asleep!?
Come on, Sophie! Wake up!"
"Not good. Wolf's asleep!
We gotta wake him up!"
"Hey! We can't sleep now!
Wake uuuuuup!"
"Uh-oh, Joker's asleep!
You better wake up quick!"
"Skull, don't fall asleep on the job!
Up and at 'em!"
Mona! Don't go to sleep right there!
"Whoa, Panther's sleeping!
Hey, look out!"
"Fox is dozing off! This is no
time for a nap, Inari!"
"Queen's been put to sleep! She's
in danger all by herself!"
"Noir fell asleep! Wake up, or
you'll be in trouble!"
"Sophie, did you fall asleep?
Listen, you gotta get up!"
"Seriously, Wolf, you're sleeping!?
Get up, Gramps!"
"No, don't fall asleep!
Hey, are you listening!?
Wake up!"
"Joker's been hit with Fear!
He won't be able to move!"
"Skull's paralyzed with fear!
He can't move like this!"
Ngh... Too scared... Can't move.
"Panther's been hit with Fear!
She can't move till it wears off!"
"Fox is frozen with fear!
He can't move!"
"Queen's overcome with fear!
She can't move like this!"
"Noir's paralyzed with fear!
She won't be able to move!"
"Oh no! Sophie's frozen with fear!
She can't move!"
"Wolf's succumbed to his fear!
He can't move till the effect wears off!"
Oh no! They're paralyzed with fear!
"Joker's paralyzed with fear!
He can't move a muscle!"
"Skull's quaking in his boots!
Pull yourself together, man!"
"Mona's scared stiff. I know you're no
scaredy-cat, but c'mon..."
"Panther's struck with fear! Help her—
she's down on the ground!"
"Fox is frozen in fear!
He can't act like this..."
"Queen's cowering in fear!
Look, she can't even stand!"
"Noir is shivering with fright!
Her legs won't even move!"
"Sophie's clearly afraid.
She can't do much in this state."
"Come on, Wolf, get over it!
This is no time to give into
fear!"
"Someone's inflicted with Fear! If they
don't shake it off, they're toast!"
"Joker's blind with rage!
Joker, you gotta calm down!"
This is bad! Skull's on a rampage!
Rrrarrrgh! Must. Destroy. Shadows!
"Panther's overcome with rage!
J-Just calm down, Panther!"
"Fox is out of control!
Hey! Take it easy!"
"Queen's seriously pissed off!
She's a loose cannon!"
"Noir's been hit with Rage!
Watch out for her!"
"Sophie's blinded by rage!
She's relentless!"
"Wolf's gone rabid!?
Easy, Wolf! Don't get carried away!"
"Hey, calm down! Don't let your
anger get the better of you!"
"Joker, you're that mad? Just so you
know, you're defenseless!"
"Classic Skull, going on a rampage...
Wait a sec—stop it!"
"Mona's lost his temper!
Hey, just settle down!"
"Panther's seeing red!
She won't listen to a word I say!"
"Fox is enraged and out of control!
I don't like this side of him..."
"Queen's on the warpath!
That is way too scary!"
"Uh-oh, I think Noir snapped!
Gah, she's out for blood!"
"Even Sophie's enraged?
Oh no, she's going berserk!"
"Wolf, get a grip! Aren't adults
supposed to watch their tempers?"
"Don't let your anger control you!
Uh, think about something relaxing!"
"Oh no! Joker's been brainwashed!
He's gonna attack!"
"Skull's been brainwashed!
He can't tell friend from foe!"
"Meowowow! Friends? Enemies?
It's all the same to me!"
"P-Panther's been brainwashed!
She can't tell friend from foe!"
"Fox's been brainwashed!
He's attacking everything in sight!"
"Queen's been brainwashed!
Hey, we're on your side!"
"Noir's been brainwashed!
She thinks we're the enemy!"
"Sophie's been brainwashed!
Hey! We're on a team, remember!?"
"Wolf's been brainwashed!?
Watch out, he's on the loose!"
"They've been brainwashed!
They can't tell friend from foe!"
"Joker's been brainwashed!
He can't tell friend from foe!"
"Is Skull brainwashed!?
He thinks we're the enemy!"
"Mona's been brainwashed!
Hey, we're on you're side!"
"Panther's brainwashed?
Does that mean she'll attack us!?"
"Fox, you're brainwashed!
No, the enemy's THAT way!"
"Queen's acting strange...
Hey, we're your teammates!
Come on!"
"Looks like they got to Noir...
She can't tell anyone apart!"
"Oh no, they brainwashed Sophie!
She's turning on us!"
"Wolf's brainwashed!
Don't attack us...
Bad Wolf! BAD!"
"Someone's been brainwashed!
They can't tell friend from foe!"
"Joker's back in the game!
That was a close one."
"Skull's good to go!
Time for some payback!"
Good grief... That was awful.
"Panther's back to normal!
You really had me worried..."
"Fox is back in it!
Now we bring the fight to them!"
"Queen's back to normal!
Here comes the counterattack!"
Noir's back! Don't overdo it now!
"Sophie's recovered!
Are you okay, Sophie?"
"Wolf's ready to go!
You had me going there..."
"Looks like you're back to normal.
Now, let 'em have it!"
"Joker's good to go!
Everything all right?"
"Skull's raring to go! Things were
looking dicey for a sec..."
"Mona's all better! Now show 'em
what you're made of!"
"Panther's back in the fight!
Time to bring the heat!"
"Fox is back in business!
Make 'em pay!"
"Queen's back in the game!
Bet they'll be hurting soon!"
"Noir's doing just fine now!
That was a close one!"
"Sophie's all back to normal!
What a relief!"
"Wolf is back in action!
Go tear 'em up!"
"You're back and better than ever!
Now it's time for payback!"
"This is bad! Hang in there, everyone!"
Not good! Joker's down!
Oh no! Skull's been knocked down!
Owww!
Panther's down!
Not good! Fox is down!
Ah! Queen's down!
Noir's been knocked down!
"Whoa, Sophie's down!"
Wolf's down! Watch out!
Hey! You all right?
"Everyone, hold your ground!
C'mon, I know we can do this!"
Joker's down! This is bad!
Skull's knocked down! Hang in there!
"Mona's down!
This doesn't look good!"
Panther's down! Are you okay!?
*gasp* Fox is down!
Queen got knocked down!
"Come on, Noir, get up!"
"Bad news, people!
Sophie's knocked down!"
"Oh no, Wolf's been knocked down!"
Ahh! Don't let them trip you up!
All right! Time to strike back!
Skull's up! Hit 'em hard!
Time for my big comeback!
Yes! Panther's up!
"Okay, Fox! Time for a counterattack!"
"Queen's back on her feet!
Make 'em pay!"
Noir's back up! Let's return the favor!
Sophie's up! Let 'em have it!
Wolf's up! Now it's our turn!
All right! Here comes the payback!
Okay! Now take the offensive!
Skull's back up! Time to get even!
Yes! Mona's back on his feet!
"Panther's okay now!
Ready for revenge?"
Fox! It's time to retaliate!
"Here comes Queen! She's back up
and never backs down!"
"Noir's back on the frontlines!
Time to make up our losses! "
"Sophie's back in form!
Time to return the favor!"
"Wolf is up once again!
Now strike back!"
"All right, now give 'em a fight for
the record books!"
Joker's out!? Hurry up and treat him!
"Skull's out of the fight!
Can we get him back in?"
"Damn, I overdid it...
Gotta fall back!"
"Panther's fallen back!
Someone help her!"
"Fox had to retreat!
Someone patch him up!"
"Queen's pulled back!
She needs help!"
"Noir dropped back!?
We gotta help her!"
"Sophie had to fall back!
Can we help her out?"
"Wolf pulled out of the fight!
Can anyone heal him?"
"Damn! They're down!
They need help!"
"Joker fell back!
We gotta patch him up quick!"
"Skull made a hasty retreat!
I think he needs help!"
"Mona's retreated!
Can someone heal him!?"
"Panther had to fall back!
She needs emergency treatment!"
"Fox had to withdraw!
Someone fix him up!"
"Queen's out of the battle!
Can somebody heal her up?"
"Noir had to retreat!
Make sure she gets first aid!"
"Sophie's withdrawn from battle!
Can anybody heal her!?"
"Wolf's fallen back!
He needs medical attention!"
"We lost someone!?
They're gonna need healing!"
"Whoa! Lookin' cool, Joker!"
"Wow, Skull! Way to move!"
"Aaannnd... Nailed it!
Mewhehehe!"
"Beautiful as always, Panther!
Woohoo!"
"Perfect form, Fox!"
"That was amazing, Queen!
I'm on the edge of my seat!"
"I see you, Beauty Thief!"
"That was incredible, Sophie!"
"Wow, did you see Wolf!?
He totally stole the show!"
"Whoa, you make this look easy!"
"Mindblowing as always, Joker!"
"Ooh, good one, Skull!"
"Nice one, Mona!
You really outdid yourself!"
"Panther, you had me mesmerized!
Too cool!"
"Not too shabby, Fox!
Didn't know you had it in ya!"
All hail the Queen! No mercy!
"Yes! I wanna see more
Beauty Thief in action!"
"You're on another level, Sophie!
Glad they didn't nerf ya!"
I knew you were no ordinary geezer!
"Ooh, fancy stuff!"
Let's end this!
Ready!? Let's do it!
They're finished!
Beat the stuffing out of 'em!
They're all knocked down!
Time for an All-Out Attack!
Send 'em into next week!
Time for the finisher!
Get 'em!
Prepare to meet your dooooom!
It's all over!
Let's end it with a bang!
"It's Showtime! Take it away, Joker!"
"It's Showtime!
Let loose on 'em, Skull!"
It's Showtime! Check this out!
"It's Showtime!
Show us how it's done, Panther!"
"It's Showtime! Okay, Fox!
Let 'em see what true beauty
looks like!"
"It's Showtime! Go for it, Queen!
No holding back!"
"It's Showtime!
Let's see what you've got, Noir!"
"It's Showtime!
Spotlight's on you, Sophie!"
"It's Showtime!
They're all yours, Wolf!"
"It's Showtime!
Look alive, team!"
"It's Showtime! Go for it, Joker!"
"You're up, Skull! It's Showtime!"
"All right, Mona, show 'em
what time it is!"
"Showtime! Take it away, Panther!"
"Okay, Fox, it's Showtime!
Make it spectacular!"
"It's Showtime!
Blow 'em away, Queen!"
"Showtime! It's all on you, Noir!"
"It's Showtime, and it's Sophie's
moment to shine!"
"Hit 'em hard, Wolf! It's Showtime!"
This is your chance! It's Showtime!
"Nice going, Joker!
That's a clean hit!"
"Nice hit, Skull!"
"So, whaddya think?
Pretty impressive, right?"
"Ooh! You're the best, Panther!"
"Way to land one, Fox!"
Queen's landed a hit!
That's one for Noir!
"Nice hit, Sophie! Way to go!"
"Great job, Wolf! That's a hit!"
You did it! Way to hit!
Joker's skill connected!
Skull landed an explosive hit!
"Direct hit, Mona! Nice one!"
Panther's skill found its mark!
Fox got a clean hit!
"Beautiful work, Queen!"
Noir's skill was right on target!
"Whoa, that was awesome, Sophie!"
Wolf left a mark with that skill!
Bingo! That skill just now? Perfection!
"Nice, Joker! You struck its weakness!"
"You hit its weakness!
Way to go, Skull!"
I hit its weakness! Did you see me!?
"That's its weakness!
Keep it up, Panther!"
"Direct hit on the enemy's
weakness! Nice aim, Fox!"
"That's a direct hit on its weakness!
You're amazing, Queen!"
"You got its weakness!
Nice going, Noir!"
"You hit its weakness!
Great job, Sophie!"
"Right in its weakness!
Way to go, Wolf!"
You hit its weakness!
"Nice, Joker! You hit its weakness!"
"You hit its weakness!
Way to go, Skull!"
"You hit its weakness!
Keep it up, Mona!"
"You struck its weakness!
Don't let up, Panther!"
"Yup, that's its weakness!
You're on a roll, Fox!"
"Right in the weak point!
Totally a Queen move."
"Great job, Noir!
You hit 'em right where it hurts!"
"Way to go, Sophie!
You hit its weakness with style!"
"You got its weakness!
That was savage, Wolf!"
Gotta exploit those weaknesses!
"That didn't do much...
Try attacking with something else!"
"Yeah, that's not gonna work.
Might wanna change
up your approach."
"Hey, not bad! That'll show 'em!"
"Whoa, that was some crazy damage!"
"Ohh... This might be just what
the Phantom Thieves ordered."
"I think we could blow these up!
Let's use them against the enemy!"
"A party popper? We could do
some major damage with these!"
"Mewheheh, this looks like fun!
Let's take it for a spin!"
"I think we can use this!
Let's bring down the house!"
"Are those blades sticking out over
there? Maybe we can throw them at
the enemy."
"Oh, this is perfect!
We'll be running circles around 'em!"
"Hm? We might be able to use this...
Is there a switch somewhere?"
"Looks like these slide when pushed.
Try smacking the enemy with them!"
"This glass looks breakable.
Maybe we can ambush
those on the other side."
"That might come in handy.
Think we could attack with it?"
"Ooh, an explosive...
Let's blow these Shadows
to smithereens!"
"That is one ginormous party popper!
Bet it could do some damage!"
Whee! Let's shred our way to victory!
"That dangly thing up there...
What if we dropped it on the
enemy? Mwehehe..."
"Those look pretty sharp...
Try throwing it at someone!"
"Looks like you can jump on those.
Use them right, and we'll run circles
around the enemy!"
"Ooh, that's a real beaut! Makes a
geek girl wanna cry... Now zap 'em!"
"If we give this ice block a push,
it'll smush the enemy good!"
"If we broke this glass, it might give
the enemy on the other side a nasty
surprise!"
"Wow, smooth moves!"
"Stylish as ever, Joker!"
"Hey, you're pretty good, Skull."
Who knew I had it in me?
"Yeah! Nice one, Panther!"
"Good one, Fox!"
"That was perfect, Queen!"
"That's it, Noir!"
"Nice dodge, Sophie!"
"Wow, Wolf!
Way to think on your feet!"
You did it! Way to move!
That was some god-tier dodging!
"Haha, can't touch Joker! "
"Way to go, Skull!"
"That was perfect, Mona!"
And Panther dodges with style!
"Fox, with the fancy footwork!"
"Keep 'em guessing, Queen!"
"Nice evasion, Noir!"
"You're just too fast for 'em, Sophie!"
"Evasive action confirmed!
Good job, Wolf!"
"Ooh, nice dodge!"
"Critical hit! Too cool, Joker!"
"That's a critical hit!
Nice move, Skull!"
Mhm! All in a day's work!
"That's a clean hit!
You go, Panther!"
"Clean hit! Looking good, Fox!"
"Critical hit! Just beautiful, Queen!"
"That got 'em! Keep it up, Noir!"
"Nice hit! You're doing great, Sophie!"
"That's it, Wolf! Critical hit!"
"Wow, great hit!"
"BAM! Stylish as always, Joker!"
"Nice damage, Skull! Rack it up!"
"Mona, nice crit!"
"Whip it good, Panther!
Keep up those crits!"
"Critical hit! You're killing it, Fox!"
"Heck yeah, Queen!
Squash 'em like bugs!"
"Good going, Noir!
That knocked 'em for a loop!"
"That was a clean hit!
You rule, Sophie!"
"That was some heavy annihilation!
Go Wolf!"
Nice crit there!
All right! That did it!
"Excellent! We got 'em in the palm
of our hand!"
Perfect! They won't forget that one!
Great! That move was flawless!
Mhm! All according to plan.
"Whoa, neato!"
Superb!
Technical for the win!
"Ooh, nailed it! Too cool!"
Whoa! That's how you do it!
"The enemy's burning.
[1B]M0~5~Wind or [1B]M0~7~Nuke
should do it!"
"The enemy's frozen!
Use a [1B]M0~7~Nuclear attack!"
"The enemy's been shocked.
A [1B]M0~7~Nuclear attack'll do the trick!"
"The enemy's dizzy.
Hit 'em with everything you got!"
"The enemy's been hit with Forget.
Follow up with a [1B]M0~6~Psy attack!"
The enemy's asleep! Let 'em have it!
"The enemy's overcome with Fear!
Hit 'em with a [1B]M0~6~Psy attack!"
"The enemy's been hit with Rage!
Keep your distance and blast 'em
with [1B]M0~6~Psy attacks!"
"The enemy's been brainwashed!
[1B]M0~6~Psy attacks'll go long way here!"
"The enemy's burning up!
Smear 'em with [1B]M0~5~Wind
or [1B]M0~7~Nuclear attacks!"
"The foe's frozen!
Hit it with a [1B]M0~7~Nuclear
attack to really bring the damage!"
"The enemy's shocked.
Send it off with a
[1B]M0~7~Nuclear attack!"
"The enemy's dizzy! This is your
chance—start whaling on 'em!"
"Forgetful enemies are vulnerable
to [1B]M0~6~Psychokinesis!
Go for a technical hit!"
The enemy's asleep and wide open!
"The enemy's scared of you!
Use [1B]M0~6~Psychokinesis and
give 'em their worst nightmare!"
"[1B]M0~6~Psychokinesis is really
effective on enraged enemies!
Take advantage!"
"The enemy's brainwashed.
Dish out the pain with
[1B]M0~6~Psy attacks!"
"Whoa, nice one!
Way to use your head!"
"Job well done, Skull!"
"I'd expect nothing less from
someone as good as me!"
"Great job, Panther!
You pulled that off perfectly!"
"Nice, Fox! That was perfect!"
"That's it, Queen!
You sure know your
way around a fight!"
"Ooh, nice one, Noir!
That was some quick thinking!"
"Hey, there's an idea!
Good thinking, Sophie!"
"Wow, Wolf!
That was pretty sneaky of you!"
Ooh! That was pretty clever!
"That's the ticket
Good thinking, Joker!"
"Wow, Skull.
Didn't expect that level
of thinking from you."
"Mona, how clever! I like that!"
"Good move, Panther!"
"Genius, Fox!
You never miss an
opportunity, do ya?"
"Queen, always the strategist!"
"That turned out great, Noir!
Lovin' it!"
"Good one, Sophie!
Keep up the pressure!"
"Wolf, that was a pretty smart play!"
"Nice one!
You pulled that off real smooth."
Joker landed a follow-up attack!
"Way to jump in, Skull!"
"Heh, I could do this all day!"
"Way to follow-up, Panther!
That was perfect!"
"Great teamwork, Fox!"
"That's it, Queen! Nice follow-up!"
Noir landed a follow-up attack!
"Excellent follow-up, Sophie!"
Wolf scored another one!
All right! That's another hit!
Joker got in a follow-up attack!
"Right on the money, Skull!"
And Mona follows up!
"Beautiful combo, Panther!"
"Way to follow up, Fox!"
"Queen, that combo strike was
devastating!"
"Noir came in swinging for
extra carnage!"
"Wicked follow-up, Sophie!"
"Damn, Wolf chased 'em down with
a follow-up attack!"
Yes! You landed a follow-up attack!
"That was a tough one!
Nice going, Joker!"
"Skull brought it down!
Great job!"
"They sure put up a fight...
Nothing I can't handle, though!"
"Panther brought down a tough one!
She's so beautiful!"
"Fox took out a tough one!
Way to go!"
"That's how we do it, Queen!
No enemy's too strong!"
"You're amazing, Noir!
That one was really strong!"
"Whoa, nice one, Sophie!
That was a tough fight!"
"Nice job, Wolf! That one was tough!"
You took it down! Great work!
"Joker defeated a strong enemy,
just like that!"
"Skull took down a strong enemy!
I wanna see more of that!"
"Mona beat a strong enemy!
Awesome!"
"Panther took down a strong enemy,
and stylishly to boot!"
"Powerful Shadow eliminated.
Way to go, Fox!"
"A powerful Shadow bit the dust!
Typical Queen..."
"Coup de grâce administered!
Very swanky, Noir!"
"Ooh, Sophie took out a strong
Shadow! Good job!"
"Yikes!
Wolf tore that big Shadow to shreds!"
"Powerful Shadow defeated!
Nice teamwork!"
"Awesome job, Joker!
That's our fearless leader!"
"Impressive, Skull!
I felt good just watching that!"
"How was that!? Pretty amazing, huh?"
"Ooh! Even the enemy's stunned
by Panther's beauty!"
"That's it, Fox!
They're no match for you!"
"Nothing gets left in Queen's wake...
She's a true living legend!"
"You're really putting in work, Noir!
I'm so proud of you!"
"Wow, you're really
something, Sophie!
I better step up my game!"
"It's crazy, seeing an adult do all this!
We're counting on you, Wolf!"
Wow! You blew 'em away!
"Oh man, talk about a showstopper!
And that's why Joker's in charge!"
"Man, Skull, that was crazy!
You really took care of business!"
"Whoa, Mona took out a whole wave
of 'em! Nice going!"
"Yes! Panther, that was just what we
needed!"
"Multiple enemies eliminated!
You did it, Fox!"
"Solid work, Queen!
I was happy just seeing that!"
"Noir took out a group of enemies!
Nothing can stop her now!"
"Sophie, you're tearing
it up out there!
Keep going!"
"Wolf, you totally owned those guys!
At your age, too!"
"Mwehehe!
They're dropping like
dead sparrows!"
"The enemy's attack power's up!
They're gonna hit even harder now!"
"Enemy defense is up!
This doesn't look good..."
"The enemy's speed went up!
Watch your backs, everyone!"
"The enemy raised their attack power!
You DO NOT wanna get hit right now!"
"Dangit, the enemy buffed their
defense!"
"The enemy boosted their speed!
Stay on your toes, people!"
Ohh! Enemy attack power's down!
"The enemy's defense is down!
Focus on the attack!"
All right! The enemy's speed is down!
"All right, the enemy's attack power's
been reduced!"
"The enemy's defense is down!
Go to town on 'em! "
"Enemy speed is lowered! Let's see
them try to hit us now!"
"Hey, big attack incoming!
Brace yourselves!"
"The enemy's powering up!
Eyes open, everyone!"
"That Shadow's up to something...
Is it trying to gain the upper hand?"
"They're trying to heal!
Stop them before its too late!"
Incoming attack! Brace yourselves!
"Looks like they're powering up!
Watch for any stat changes!"
"They're up to something... Trying to
weaken our stats, no doubt!"
"The enemy's trying to heal!
Shut that down quick!"
"They're a lot stronger than us!
Don't do anything reckless!"
"They look tough. We'll need to
be careful!"
"Fair warning, this one's gonna be
rough!"
"Aww man... That one looks tough.
Everyone stay focused!"
"Evenly matched, huh?
Don't let your guard down."
"It's an even fight. Treat it like any
other fight, and there shouldn't be
a problem."
"Don't worry, I know we got this!"
"Enemy power level... Nothing special.
Take 'em down!"
"They're weaker than us. Should be
an easy win as long as we're careful."
"Hmm, they're not very strong.
Let's wrap this up quick!"
"Oh, just a trash mob. Easy victory ahead!"
They're pitiful. Give 'em a dirt nap!
"They're tough but weak to
[1B]M0~0~Physical attacks... Let's
use that to our advantage!"
"They're strong, but [1B]M0~1~Gun
attacks'll cut 'em down to size!
Light 'em up!"
"They look strong... Let's play to their
weakness and use [1B]M0~2~Fire attacks!"
"They're pretty tough! Use [1B]M0~3~Ice
attacks and strike their weakness!"
"This one's strong... We should exploit
their weakness to [1B]M0~5~Wind attacks!"
"They're weak to [1B]M0~4~Electricity! They
might be strong, but we can take 'em!"
"The enemy's strong! Use their
weakness to [1B]M0~8~Bless and take 'em out!"
"This enemy's tough! Go for their
weakness and use [1B]M0~9~Curse attacks!"
"They're strong but weak to
[1B]M0~7~Nuclear attacks... Let's use
it to our advantage!"
"The enemy looks strong... Exploit
their weakness to [1B]M0~6~Psy attacks!"
"It's strong, but it's weak to
[1B]M0~0~Physical attacks!"
"The enemy's strong, but it's weak to
[1B]M0~1~Gun attacks! Ready, aim, fire!"
"It's tough, but it's weak to [1B]M0~2~Fire!
You can handle this!"
"This guy's pretty strong! Capitalize on
its [1B]M0~3~Ice weakness!"
"The enemy's no pushover. Target its
weakness to [1B]M0~5~Wind!"
"It's weak to [1B]M0~4~Electricity! It's
strong, so keep your guard up!"
"It's powerful, but it's weak to
[1B]M0~8~Bless attacks! Give 'em divine
punishment!"
"It's a strong one. Exploit its weakness
to [1B]M0~9~Curse!"
"This one's strong! Hammer its weak
point with [1B]M0~7~Nuclear attacks!"
"It's powerful, but you can exploit its
weakness with [1B]M0~6~Psychokinesis!"
"They're weak to [1B]M0~0~Physical
attacks! That's our best chance!"
"[1B]M0~1~Gun attacks'll do the trick!
Lock and load!"
"Hey... Looks like the enemy's weak
to [1B]M0~2~Fire."
"Let's see... Looks like this one's weak
to [1B]M0~3~Ice."
It's weak to [1B]M0~5~Wind! Blow it away!
"This one's weak to [1B]M0~4~Electricity!
That's the key!"
"It's weak to [1B]M0~8~Bless attacks!
Think we can hit it?"
"Looks like this one's weak to
[1B]M0~9~Curse..."
It's weak to [1B]M0~7~Nuclear attacks!
"This one's weak to
[1B]M0~6~Psychokinesis!"
"It's weak to [1B]M0~0~Physical attacks!
Beat it to a pulp!"
"It's weak to [1B]M0~1~Gun attacks!
Unload on 'em!"
"It's weak to [1B]M0~2~Fire!
Let's turn up the heat!"
It's weak to [1B]M0~3~Ice! Frost 'em up!
"It's super weak to [1B]M0~5~Wind,
so blow 'em away!"
"It's weak to [1B]M0~4~Electricity. You all
charged up?"
"It's weak to [1B]M0~8~Bless attacks!
Time to unleash some miracles!"
"It's weak to [1B]M0~9~Curse attacks!
Send them to their doom!"
"Looks like this one's weak to
[1B]M0~7~Nuclear attacks!"
"This one's weak to
[1B]M0~6~Psychokinesis."
"These small fry are weak to
[1B]M0~0~Physical attacks!
Let's make this quick!"
"They're weak to [1B]M0~1~Gun attacks!
Take 'em out!"
"We're stronger than these guys!
Use [1B]M0~2~Fire and strike their weakness!"
"They're weak to [1B]M0~3~Ice.
This fight's ours!"
"They're no match for us!
Take 'em down with [1B]M0~5~Wind attacks!"
"[1B]M0~4~Electricity'll get the job done!
Show 'em who's boss!"
"It's weak to [1B]M0~8~Bless skills, huh?
They don't stand a chance!"
"They're weak against [1B]M0~9~Curse!
Let's make this quick!"
"They're weak to [1B]M0~7~Nuclear!
Let's take 'em out!"
This one calls for [1B]M0~6~Psy attacks. Shouldn't be any trouble.
"Ooh, it's weak to [1B]M0~0~Physical
attacks! I'd hate to be you right now!"
"Riddle 'em with [1B]M0~1~Gun attacks—
that's its weakness!"
"Its weakness is [1B]M0~2~Fire! Burn 'em
to a crisp!"
"Its weakness is [1B]M0~3~Ice!
Freeze 'em solid!"
"It's weak and it hates [1B]M0~5~Wind.
Keep that in mind!"
"It doesn't like [1B]M0~4~Electricity. I
know it's weak, but don't get sloppy!"
"It's weak to [1B]M0~8~Bless attacks!
Let's wrap this up quick!"
"Its weak to [1B]M0~9~Curse. Focus your
attacks around that!"
"It's weak to [1B]M0~7~Nuclear attacks!
Blast 'em!"
"[1B]M0~6~Psychokinesis should do the
trick! Go for it!"
"They're strong, and [1B]M0~0~Physical
attacks won't work... This is gonna
be tough!"
"They're tough! [1B]M0~1~Gun attacks
won't work, so be careful!"
"This enemy's tough... Avoid using
[1B]M0~2~Fire attacks!"
"They're strong, and they're resistant
to [1B]M0~3~Ice. Don't waste your shot!"
"[1B]M0~5~Wind's useless against them!
This'll probably be a tough fight,
so be on your guard!"
"The enemy's powerful, and
[1B]M0~4~Electricity's no good!"
"They're strong! [1B]M0~8~Bless isn't
an option, so be careful!"
"[1B]M0~9~Curse won't work here.
And the enemy's tough, too... If
we could just find its weakness."
"They're tough, and [1B]M0~7~Nuclear
attacks are powerless against them.
We'll need to try something else."
"They're really strong...
[1B]M0~6~Psychokinesis is out, too."
"It's strong AND immune to
[1B]M0~0~Physical attacks!? That's
broken!"
"It's strong, and [1B]M0~1~Gun attacks
won't work! Watch out!"
"[1B]M0~2~Fire won't work, plus it's
super strong! Be careful out
there!"
"This one's strong, and [1B]M0~3~Ice is
a no-go! Don't slip up!"
"It's powerful, and [1B]M0~5~Wind is
ineffective! What a cheater!"
"It's immune to [1B]M0~4~Electricity,
plus it's real strong. Watch your
back!"
"This one's powerful, and
[1B]M0~8~Bless attacks won't
work!"
"It's stronger than us, and
[1B]M0~9~Curse won't work on
it. But don't be intimidated!"
"It's tough, and [1B]M0~7~Nuclear
attacks are useless. Be ready
for anything!"
"It's powerful, and strong against
[1B]M0~6~Psychokinesis! Keep that
in mind!"
"[1B]M0~0~Physical attacks won't work
on this one!"
"That one's bulletproof! You'll have
to go with something else!"
"[1B]M0~2~Fire's useless against them!
Watch out!"
"[1B]M0~3~Ice isn't an option here!
Try something else!"
"[1B]M0~5~Wind's not effective against
them... That could be a problem."
"Careful! [1B]M0~4~Electricity's useless
here!"
"[1B]M0~8~Bless attacks are useless!
We'll have to beat 'em with
something else!"
"[1B]M0~9~Curse doesn't work on
them. Watch yourselves!"
"The enemy is resistant to
[1B]M0~7~Nuclear!"
"[1B]M0~6~Psychokinesis is no good
here!"
"[1B]M0~0~Physical attacks don't even
scratch it!"
"[1B]M0~1~Guns won't leave a mark.
Try using something else."
"Careful, [1B]M0~2~Fire won't work
on that one."
"[1B]M0~3~Ice won't work on this
one! You'll have to use something
else!"
"[1B]M0~5~Wind won't do anything
to it. Don't forget!"
"[1B]M0~4~Electricity won't work on it.
You'll need to come up with
something else."
"[1B]M0~8~Bless attacks are useless
here. Careful about that."
"[1B]M0~9~Curse doesn't work on
this enemy!"
"This enemy's immune to
[1B]M0~7~Nuclear attacks. Use
anything but that!"
"[1B]M0~6~Psy attacks won't work
here. Pick something else!"
"They're weak, but it looks like
[1B]M0~0~Physical attacks are out..."
"Should be an easy fight.
[1B]M0~1~Guns won't work, though,
so steer clear!"
"Fireproof, huh? They're weak,
but don't underestimate them."
"[1B]M0~3~Ice won't cut it. The
enemy's weak, but don't
get careless."
"We're stronger than them, but
[1B]M0~5~Wind won't help us."
"Careful. They're not very
strong, but they're immune
to [1B]M0~4~Electricity."
"They're immune to [1B]M0~8~Bless!
Use something else to take 'em
out!"
"They're weak, but [1B]M0~9~Curse
doesn't seem to work on them.
Stay on your guard."
"[1B]M0~7~Nuclear's no good, huh?
Pretty annoying for how weak they are."
"[1B]M0~6~Psy attacks are useless
here. We'll have to use something
else."
"It's weak, but [1B]M0~0~Physical
attacks won't work. What a
pain in the butt!"
"It's puny, but [1B]M0~1~Gun attacks
won't dent it. Don't waste your
ammo."
"It's weaker than us, but it's
immune to [1B]M0~2~Fire. Don't
get careless."
"If [1B]M0~3~Ice won't do it... Then
stomp it to smithereens!"
"[1B]M0~5~Wind won't work, but it's
hardly a threat. Flick it to death!"
"It's weak, but [1B]M0~4~Electricity's out of the question. Remember that."
"[1B]M0~8~Bless attacks are no good.
Make sure to use something else."
"It's weak as heck, but it nullifies
[1B]M0~9~Curse. Just be careful of
that."
"[1B]M0~7~Nuclear attacks won't work,
but it's not that strong. Handle
it!"
"It's low-level, but it nullfies
[1B]M0~6~Psy! So just mow 'em
down!"
"Joker!? Get up! Come on, you gotta
get up! Joker!"
"Hang in there, Skull!
You can't let it end here!"
Ngh... I'm sorry...
"No! Panther! This can't be happening.
Say something!"
"Hey, Fox!? Get up... Come on, Fox!"
Queen... No... This can't be the end...
Noir! Hang in there! Noir!
"Sophie!? Hey, wake up! Hey!"
"This isn't happening... Wolf!
Come on, say something!"
Joker!? No... Joker!
"No... Hey, Skull! Please, say
something!"
"Mona, no! Don't give up! Come on...
You gotta hang in there!"
Panther? How...? Panther!
Fox...? No... No way!
"Get up, Queen! Please!"
"No... Noir, come in! I'm begging you!"
"Sophie? Hey, what happened!?
Say something!"
"Wolf...? This can't be happening...
Come on, get back on your feet!"
"Hey, Oracle! What's wrong!? Come in!"
"I'm sorry, guys..."
No... Is this really the end?
"Wait, seriously!? No... It can't end
here!"
"Ooh, you got a new Persona?"
"That power of yours never ceases
to amaze me!"
"Hopefully, this abiltity'll keep
helping us out!"
"Ooh, got a new Persona?"
Looks like you got a new Persona!
"What Persona did you get?
C'mon, show me."
"Welp, let's get started!"
"Okay, let's do this!"
Time for some infiltration!
"Okay, we're in. Stay sharp guys."
All right. Let's get to work.
"Keep it together, everyone."
Bring it on!
Right! We got this!
Time to teach these creeps a lesson!
Hah. This should be interesting.
"Now then, let's begin, shall we?"
"Well then, shall we get back to work?"
"Now then, let's get started."
Is everyone ready?
Let's stay focused.
"Now, let's begin!"
I'll do my best!
We're heading in!
"Okay, let's get going!"
Leave the navigation to me!
And we're off!
Make way for the Phantom Thieves!
Okay. We're moving out.
"I promise to do my best. I won't
let you down."
"Well then, let's hop to it."
Let's make this as brisk as possible.
If only PubSec could see me now...
"That's it for the day, huh?"
"Sweet, let's bounce."
Guess we'll call it here!
Should we head back for now?
"Okay, let's get outta here."
Yeah. Better quit while we're ahead.
"Okay, let's head back."
Let's call it a day!
"Phew. Good job, everyone!"
Perhaps we should return home.
It might serve us well to regroup.
"Very well, let's make our way back."
"Hmm, maybe we should call it a day."
"Then, shall we head back?"
Let's head back and recuperate.
"Great job, everyone!"
Let's stop here for today.
Shall we go home?
"Alrighty, then we're heading back."
"Okay, good work, people!"
"No more dungeon-crawling? Then
let's skedaddle!"
We're heading back? Understood.
"Right, let's head back."
"Okay, time to pack it in for now."
"All right, let's make our way back."
"Yeah, maybe we shouldn't overdo it."
"Whew... Guess I'm not getting any
younger."
Made it.
Ready for action. What's the plan?
We're all here. So what next?
"Okay, where to now?"
"Looks like we made it.
All right, let's move out!"
We're here. Better get moving.
All right. What's next?
Right! What's the plan?
We're here. What's our next move?
We've arrived. How shall we proceed?
"We're here. Now, what's the plan?"
"We've reached our destination.
Shall we get going, then?"
"Now that we're here, let's get going."
Okay. Let's not waste any time.
All right. What's next for us? 
Here we are. What do we do next?
Let's continue our search!
"Let's keep moving ahead.
Where do we go from here?"
We're here... So what do?
"Are we there yet? Okay, good."
"And so the adventure continues!
Where to?"
Arrived. Where to next?
We're here. What's our plan this time?
"We've arrived. And with that, let's
keep moving."
"Made it safe and sound.
Now, where to?"
"Okay, back to exploring."
"All right, let's get to work."
Let's hightail it outta here.
Run for your lives!
"Run away, run away, run away!"
We'd better back off!
Time to make our escape!
Let's ditch these creeps!
Don't fall behind!
We'll pull back for now.
Retreat and regroup!
Nobody fall behind!
I believe now's a good time to escape!
Let's flee while we can!
Diversion tactics initiated! Ruuuun!
There! Now book it!
I say we run.
Understood. Let's make our escape.
Guess we don't have a choice.
Better we live to fight another day!
"Way to go, guys!"
"Heh, that was nothin'!"
"Sweet, we got 'em!"
Come on. As if we'd lose!
"Great work, everybody!"
Hmph. Guess that's that.
Yay! We did it!
"That was really good, you guys!"
Aaand done!
Victory is ours.
That's one less obstacle in the way.
Safe to say we overwhelmed them.
"Don't forget what you've learned
from this battle."
That wasn't much of a struggle.
Is everyone all right?
Aren't you glad we won?
"Good job, everyone!"
Phew... It's over.
"Nice work, ladies and gents!"
You guys rock!
Another job well done!
"All right, we won."
That's a win.
I'm glad we won that one.
"Nicely done, kiddos."
That's how it's supposed to be.
Good thing we won.
Didn't even break a sweat!
"Hah, that all you got?"
That was almost TOO easy!
"Heh, I almost feel sorry for them..."
I'd call that an easy win!
"You call that a fight?
I nearly fell asleep."
"Easy as 1, 2, 3!"
Hehe. That was too easy!
Was that it? That was fast!
"Hah. And here I thought they'd put
up a fight."
Easier than cleaning a paintbrush.
"Hmph. Not much of a challenge,
were they?"
If only all battles were this easy.
I think we all did really well.
That victory was handed to us.
*chuckle* Like a walk in the park!
Not even worth my time!
"Hmm... I'd like at least a little more
challenge."
"Someone looks happy. Was that not
a challenge?"
"That was over before it started.
I should've taken a nap!"
"Wait, it's over? That flew by..."
"An easy win, don't you think?"
That was a quick one.
"This was over before it began.
Good job, everyone."
"They had their heads up their asses.
What else can I say?"
"I'd say we performed quite
admirably."
"Yeah, I could get used to this."
"Damn, that sucked..."
Almost thought we were goners...
Phew... What a workout.
I think we just barely pulled that off...
That one was pretty tough...
Everyone okay? That was a close one...
Crap... That one was tough...
Good thing we got through that one...
Th-That was scary...
That was rather troublesome...
Urgh... A fearsome foe indeed...
"My, that was quite an encounter..."
That was a close one...
"That was tougher than I
expected..."
I should've taken more precautions...
Th-That was maybe a bit too tough...
"I'd say that was rather difficult...
Is everyone okay?"
"We managed to pull through
somehow..."
"What even was that? The power
level was astronomical..."
"Gah! That was way too intense!
Everyone's limbs intact?"
"Okay, that was crazy! Anyone else
freakin' out here!?"
We barely won that one...
That took longer than anticipated...
I'm sure we can do better...
"Sheesh, that nearly killed us..."
Glad we made it out alive.
"Well, we're still kicking,
aren't we?"
"All right, on to the next!"
"Okay, let's move."
Okay! On to the next one!
Good. On to the next.
"Okay, let's keep it moving."
Let's go on ahead!
Let's keep chugging along!
"Okay, let's keep going."
"Let's keep moving ahead, shall we?"
"Good stuff, guys! Keep it comin'!"
Nice one. Keep it up!
All right! No time to waste!
"Let's keep up the pace, shall we?"
"We should apply the same effort in
the next battle."
"Here's hoping the next one's just
as easy!"
"Okay, let's keep it moving!"
Let's move on.
"Okay, let's keep this up."
"It's cool. Always room to improve,
right?"
"Let's take what we've learned
and keep going!"
No big! We'll do better next time!
"We'll redeem ourselves on the
next one."
I need to fight better next time...
I'm sure we'll do better next time!
"Aww, don't let it get to ya."
No problem at all.
"Well, that's over and done with."
Huh? The heck is that?
Huh. I wanna check that out.
"Yo, I mighta found somethin'."
Hmm. I'm sensing something nearby.
Oh? That looks suspicious...
"Hey, I'm picking up something
close by."
What's that?
"Hey, what do you think that is?"
"Hmm, I wonder what this is..."
"Hm? There's something peculiar
over there."
It appears we've found something...
Something here's calling to me...
What could that be?
"Oh, what is that? Can we take a look?"
Why don't we see what that is...
I think I see something over there.
What's that over there?
"Oh, I wonder what that is?
Should we go find out?"
"Ooh, what's that?"
"Oh? This may be relevant to
my interests."
"Something's there!
Let's check it out!"
What is that?
This might be of interest.
Should we take a look?
Huh? What is that?
Hey. Wanna go check that out?
"Oh, I think I found something."
"Oh, look what we got!"
This might be what we need!
"Hmm, this is interesting."
"Well, well, what do we have here?"
"This'll help us out, right?"
All right! We got it!
"My, this is quite a find!"
This should prove useful.
I sure hope this is useful.
I guess it's not a total waste.
"This should be useful, huh?"
Hehe. Hooray!
Meh. I give it a 5 out of 10.
"Eh, we could always use it."
This seems like it'll be useful.
We'll be taking this.
Is that all that's in there?
"Wouldn't exactly call that ""treasure""..."
A checkpoint! Good timing.
"Hey, a checkpoint!"
"A checkpoint!
Don't forget to register it!"
"We haven't registered that
checkpoint yet, have we?"
"Hey, it's a checkpoint! We should
probably register it, right?"
"Huh? That checkpoint is new, isn't it?"
"Seems we've found a checkpoint!
We must register it at once!"
I've sighted a checkpoint!
"I think we should register that
checkpoint. Any objections?"
"I see a new checkpoint. I think we
should register it."
"Oh! It's a checkpoint! We should
probably register it."
"I don't think we've registered that
checkpoint yet, have we?"
"Hey, a checkpoint! Make sure
you register it."
"There's a checkpoint over yonder.
Let's find it!"
"There's a checkpoint nearby.
We should probably get it registered."
"I'm sensing something... Looks like
there's a checkpoint here. Do you
see it?"
"Hey, a checkpoint. Might wanna
register that."
"That's a new checkpoint. You gonna
go register it?"
"Y'know, I feel like there was a
checkpoint here somewhere..."
"Wasn't there a checkpoint
here not too long ago?"
"There's a checkpoint nearby.
Should we regroup?"
It's a checkpoint.
"Hey, I think there's a checkpoint
over there. Maybe we should stop by?"
"Wasn't there a checkpoint around
here somewhere?"
"I believe there's a checkpoint
nearby..."
"There's a checkpoint near here.
Shall we pay it a visit?"
Wasn't there a checkpoint nearby?
"I remember there was a checkpoint
around here..."
Isn't there a checkpoint around here?
"It's a checkpoint! Should we stop and
rest for a moment?"
"Wasn't there a checkpoint here?
Oop—never mind, I see it!"
"There's a checkpoint here. We could
always head back right now."
"There's a checkpoint near here.
I recommend stopping by."
"We're close to a checkpoint.
Maybe we should pay a visit."
"There's our checkpoint. Should we
stop by?"
"Checkpoint's over there. We gonna
regroup or what?"
"Whoa, a treasure chest!"
"Dude, check it out!
A treasure chest!"
"Yo, I found a treasure chest!"
"I see a treasure chest!
Bet there's something good inside!"
"Hey, a treasure chest...
C'mon, let's check it out!"
"Ooh, a treasure chest! Let's open it!"
Look! A treasure chest!
"Oh, a treasure chest! Lucky us!"
"Hey, look! It's a treasure chest!"
"Oh, a treasure chest! I imagine we're
going to open it?"
"A treasure chest! Come, let's open it!"
"Oh, it's a treasure chest!
We mustn't overlook it!"
"Hey, there's a treasure chest. Maybe
we should peek inside."
"Oh, a treasure chest!"
"Looks like a treasure chest to me.
Want to open it?"
"I see a treasure chest! Maybe there's
something good inside!"
"Ah, a treasure chest! Let's see what's
inside!"
"Hey, should we open up that
treasure chest?"
"Treasure chest detected! Let's
see what's in there!"
Ooh! Yes! A treasure chest!
"Yay, a treasure chest! Pop that
sucker open!"
"I've located a treasure chest.
Let's open it."
Let no treasure chest go unopened.
"There's a treasure chest ahead.
Should we open it?"
"Well, look at that. A treasure chest."
"Hey, a treasure chest. Don't mind if
I do."
"Phantom thief or not, who'd say no
to treasure?"
"Hey, I know this..."
Let's crack this thing open!
Let's see what we got.
"Now, let's see what's inside..."
What is it!? What is it!?
Hm? What' s this?
"Hehe, what do you think's inside?"
"Now, let's see what's inside..."
Hmhmhm hmmm♪
"Yes, let's see what's inside..."
Hm? This glimmer...
"Now then, reveal your contents!"
"Hey, I've seen this..."
I wonder what's in there...
Your guess is as good as mine...
*chuckle* This is so exciting!
What do you think's inside?
I wonder what's in there...
Whoa-ho-ho...
"Ooh, what's in it?"
What magical wonders lie within?
Ooh...
"Hm, look at this..."
What's inside?
"Oh, what have we here..."
Somehow I feel a bit guilty...
Now what are you hiding...
"Oh, sweet!"
Heck yeah! This thing rocks!
Who says we can't help ourselves?
Wow! Lucky!
Wooo! Nothing beats treasure!
This is what it's all about!
Yay! This is great!
"Mhm, not bad at all!"
Woohoo! This'll help!
"Ohh, this is magnificent!"
Marvelous! Simply marvelous!
"Ohh, what a glorious find!"
Well that's a nice surprise!
We can definitely use this!
"Oh, that's perfect!"
Ooh! How wonderful!
Wow! This is amazing!
"Looks like we're doing all right for
ourselves!"
The RNG gods smile upon us!
Oh. Cool. I'll take it!
Score! Now let's get some more.
"It seems we've found something of
great value."
The treasure is ours!
Finders keepers.
"Oho, I like what I'm seeing."
"...This doesn't count as robbery,
does it?"
"Hey, that's a nice haul!"
"Kay, I think we're clear.
Let's move it!"
Mmm... Nope. No Shadows here.
"No Shadows as far as I know.
Keep it movin'."
"No enemies nearby.
Let's go on ahead."
"Not a Shadow in sight.
Better keep moving."
"Not sensing any Shadows.
Okay, good to go!"
Yep. Looks like we're safe for now.
"Phew... Doesn't look like there's any
Shadows around."
Hmm... I don't see any Shadows.
"Hmm, there doesn't appear to be any
danger present."
"Excellent. I don't sense any Shadows
nearby."
"I'm not seeing any Shadows at the
moment."
Not sensing any Shadows just yet...
"No Shadows, at least not right up
ahead."
"Looks like there aren't any Shadows
here."
"Hmm... I'm not seeing any Shadows
nearby."
Phew... Looks like we're safe here.
"It doesn't look like there's any
Shadows around."
No Shadows detected here!
"Nothing on my radar. Looks
like we're safe for now."
"All clear! Nothing to worry about
here... I think."
There aren't any Shadows nearby.
"I'm not sensing any Shadows.
We're safe here."
"No Shadows at the moment.
Let's keep going."
Not seeing any Shadows.
No enemies in sight. Keep moving.
Look's like this area's clear.
"Ooh, found a Shadow! Don't get
caught off guard."
It's a Shadow! Better be careful.
Shadow here! What's the plan?
Hm!? Shadow sighted!
"There's a Shadow over there!
Watch your step!"
It's a Shadow! Stay on your guard!
Oh! A Shadow!
"It's a Shadow! Careful, okay?"
"Look, a Shadow! What do we do?"
Shadow ahead...
It's a Shadow. Careful now.
"Hm, a Shadow."
It's a Shadow. Stay alert.
"A Shadow's here. Be careful,
everyone."
"I sense a Shadow lurking about.
Proceed with extreme caution."
I see a Shadow!
"It's a Shadow! Careful, everyone!"
A Shadow! What should we do?
Nearby Shadow detected!
I'm picking up a Shadow nearby!
"Careful, there's a Shadow
lurking around."
Shadow sighted. What should we do?
There's a Shadow nearby. Be careful.
It's a Shadow... Stay focused.
I see a Shadow. Keep your guard up.
"Folks, we have a Shadow on our
hands. What's the plan?"
"Shadow sighted. Don't make any
sudden movements."
"Dude, that one's all beefed up...
Should we take it?"
Dang... That's a hefty-lookin' Shadow.
"That one's way outta our league!
Do NOT piss it off!"
"This one looks dangerous...
Be careful, now."
"That Shadow looks like bad news.
We'd better watch ourselves."
"Whoa, it's a Shadow!
And it looks pretty tough..."
Uhh... That Shadow looks pretty tough...
"Whoa! Is it just me, or does that
Shadow look really strong?"
"Ugh... That one's not going down
without a fight..."
"Shadow sighted... It looks quite
powerful."
"It's a Shadow. And a formidable one
at that..."
Tread carefully. That one's dangerous.
That Shadow looks hard to beat...
"I'm sensing a powerful Shadow
nearby. Be on guard, everyone!"
"That Shadow seems stronger than the
rest. Don't take it lightly."
That Shadow sure looks powerful...
"That one seems strong... Should we
try to fight it?"
That Shadow seems dangerous...
"There's a powerful enemy nearby.
I can sense it."
"That one looks painful...
What do we do?"
"Getting a strong reading here.
Think we can handle it?"
I've found a Shadow. It looks strong.
"That one seems much stronger than
the others. Should we still attempt to
fight?"
"That Shadow looks like it'll put
up quite a fight. We can always
avoid it if you want."
That Shadow might pose a problem...
"A Shadow! And a mighty tough one,
at that..."
"There's a strong-looking Shadow
ahead. Tread lightly."
"Whoa, a rare enemy!"
A rare enemy! After it!
"Holy crap, a rare enemy!
Let's get 'em!"
"We got a rare one! Catch it, quick!"
"Hm!? It's a rare one!
Don't let it get away!"
That's a rare one! Take it out!
"Oh, a rare one! I'd say we're pretty
lucky!"
Hey! That one's rare!
Oh! A rare Shadow! Let's get it!
A rare one... It shall not escape.
"*chuckle* We certainly don't see
those too often."
"Oh? Seems we've found a rare one.
Then, its time has come!"
"Oh, isn't that a rare enemy?"
"Look, a rare Shadow!"
"It's a rare enemy! Let's take it
down!"
Oh! Isn't that a rare one?
Look! A rare Shadow! Let's go after it!
There's a rare Shadow over there!
"That one's rare! Don't let it
out of your sights!"
"Whoa, a rare enemy!
Let's nab it!"
A rare enemy! Hunt it down!
That one's rare! Let's get it!
"There's a rare one!
Should we chase after it?"
Looks like we found a rare one.
Rare foe on the loose! After it!
A rare one! Today's our lucky day!
That enemy's rare—don't lose it!
"It's this one, right? Gonna put the
drop on 'em?"
"They're getting close... We bustin'
this guy?"
"Check out that Shadow! We can
totally wreck it from here!"
"You think we could ambush it from
here?"
"Dude, that Shadow doesn't see us.
Now's our chance!"
"Okay... think we're good to go.
We doin' this?"
Okay! This is our chance!
"Ready when you are!
Just say the word!"
"We got 'em right where we want 'em.
Whenever you're ready."
Shadow sighted! This one's ours!
"So far, so good.
It still hasn't noticed us!"
"The Shadow doesn't see us!
Let's take it down!"
Now's our chance to ambush them!
We got this!
This is our chance! Let's get 'em!
I think we can sneak up on 'em!
"We've got 'em right where we
want 'em!"
It hasn't noticed us yet. Let's do it!
"We have the advantage!
I say we take them!"
Brilliant! The first move is ours!
"Excellent, they're within range."
We can ambush them from here.
We've got them now! Let's go!
"Seems they're unaware.
Shall we attack?"
We can strike anytime. Your call.
"Okay, the enemy's right where we
want them. Do we go for it?"
Ready for ambush. Just say when!
This place is perfect for an ambush.
Target's in sight. Let's take it out.
There! It's now or never!
We can strike the enemy from here!
Let's stay focused and plan our attack!
"Steady, steady... Now!"
"I think we can ambush them...
What's our plan?"
"I don't think it's noticed us yet...
Should we go for it?"
"That Shadow hasn't noticed us.
Now's our chance!"
Ready anytime. Just say the word.
"This is our chance. Wanna give 'em
a last surprise?"
"They don't see us... I think we can
go for an ambush!"
Locked on target. Shall we?
"Okay, let's hit 'em hard!"
"If we act fast, we can ambush
them. Sound good?"
We can take this one by surprise...
Shadow located. Awaiting orders.
"That Shadow hasn't seen us...
What should we do?"
"We're in a good position.
We can attack at any time."
"It doesn't know we're here. Now
might be a good time to attack."
"They enemy hasn't noticed us...
Now's our chance."
We can ambush them! Don't miss!
I'm in position. Awaiting your signal!
"This is our chance... as long as you
don't blow our cover."
"They don't know we're here. Let's
take 'em by surprise."
Let's get them before they get us!
"We can intercept them from here.
Ready when you are!"
Shit... My poor health!
Crap... I'm all tore up...
Sorry... Kinda dyin' over here!
"Urgh... I'm not looking too good.
I guess I was careless..."
"Think I took one too many hits...
I'm in bad shape."
This is bad... I'm done for.
Ugh... I don't feel so good...
"Sorry, guys. I don't think I can do it..."
"Owww... I'm in worse shape than
I thought."
"Kgh, seems I'm worse for wear..."
"My apologies, but I can't afford to take much more of this..."
"Ngh, I can't go on..."
Agh... My health is at its limit...
Ugh! Taking too much damage...
"Sorry, everyone... I'm running low on
health..."
*pant* *pant* Not good...
I'm sorry... I can't keep up...
It's no use... I think I'm at my limit...
"I don't have much health...
This could be bad."
"I'm not doing so well...
Please heal me if you can."
I've taken too much damage...
Dammit... I'm all outta health...
Ugh... Taking a beating out here...
"*sigh* I'm getting too old for this
shit..."
"Feelin' pretty tapped here...
Think I mighta overdid it."
Ugh... My stamina's all gone.
"Dang... I'm all burnt out. Might not
be able to push through."
It's no use... I don't have enough stamina...
No good... I'm almost out of stamina.
"I burned too much stamina.
I'm running on fumes..."
*sigh* I think I'm at my limit.
I really overdid it... My bad...
My stamina's pretty much spent...
*sigh* It seems I've overdone it...
My apologies... I believe I'm at my limit...
My stamina's all but run dry...
I... think I'm low on stamina...
My stamina will run out soon...
Sorry... But my stamina's depleted.
I don't think I can fight like this...
My stamina's too low...
I'm exhausted...
"My stamina is very low.
This could be dangerous."
Hmm... I'm feeling drained...
I can't fight like this...
"Urgh, this ain't gonna work. Don't
have the stamina."
"Should've known I lacked the
stamina..."
*sigh* If only I had more stamina...
"So uhh... My stomach just growled.
You think the Shadows could hear?"
"Remember how we used to go
tearin' through Palaces together?
Ahh... Good times."
"It's nice bashin' up these Shadows
and all... But were there always so
damn many?"
"Maybe we're goin' about this all
wrong... I think they're on to us."
"Here we go again... Good thing we've
got Joker on our side!"
"Man, it's times like these I know I'm
supposed to be a Phantom Thief."
"Hey, we're Phantom Thieves,
remember? Keep the fighting to a
minimum and keep quiet!"
"Looks like they're on pretty high alert.
We're gonna have to be more careful."
"Let's get something sweet after this!
I think we deserve a little reward,
yeah?"
"Oh! I just remembered...
Hey, Joker, did you already
finish your homework?"
"I feel like I'm being watched...
Do you think it's a Shadow?"
"I think they're on high alert...
Maybe we should go..."
"These Jails certainly have an appeal
unlike that of a Palace. Should things
settle down, I'd love to paint one."
"Hm!? This composition... This would
make for an excellent painting!"
"It appears some treasure chests will
lock should the enemy learn we're
here... Unfortunate. Best tread lightly."
"Seems the enemy's on high alert...
There's more Shadows on patrol
than before."
"I wonder if these Jails are bigger than
Palaces... Bet it'd be nice to cruise
around here on Johanna."
"Just to make sure, is everyone ready
and alert? We need to be prepared
for whatever comes our way."
"Seems like they're alerted to our
presence. Don't make any rash
moves."
"We can't risk being spotted. Either
hide or find a better vantage point. "
"I feel like we're always going up and
down in these Jails. It must be pretty
difficult to remember the layout."
"Hm, this axe is super easy to swing.
I guess all that firewood-chopping
really paid off."
"Do you think we're okay? It might
not hurt to head back to the hideout
every now and then."
"The air here's changed... It's almost as
if the whole Jail's watching us..."
"Dang, these Jails are humongous.
Be sure to check your map every
now and then."
"What's with this place's layout? Just
reading the map makes my head hurt."
"Security's getting tight, so expect
some searchlights and enemy patrols."
"Protip: we can lower the security
level by ambushing some patrols."
Hmm♪ Hmm♪
"Hey, everyone, would you say I'm
useful? I really hope so."
"It seems we're being watched.
I have a bad feeling about this."
"The enemy is on high alert. I say we
turn back as soon as possible."
"Never in my life did I imagine
becoming a phantom thief.
What would Akane say about this?"
"You know, I just have to put it out
there. This outfit? It's freakin' badass."
"These Jails always give me the
heebie-jeebies... Don't think
I'll ever get used to 'em."
"Great, now we got 'em all riled up.
Let's finish up our work and get the
hell out."
"What's inside, Joker?"
"Well, Joker? What'd you find?"
"Hey Joker, what'd you find?"
Open the chest and see what's next!
"Your health is low! Make sure
you patch yourself up!"
"Whoa, you can barely stand!
Hurry up and heal!"
"Hey, are you all right?
Don't push yourself, okay?"
"You should take a minute to heal
while you have the chance."
"You might wanna heal up before the
next fight."
"Keep an eye on your health.
Try and top off now if you can."
"All right, now's our chance to
heal up."
"Your health is low. Don't do
anything crazy."
"Yeah, you're pretty beat up...
Might wanna heal."
"Watch that health. Whatever you
do, don't get blindsided."
"You're low on stamina...
Don't get careless."
"You should probably replenish your
stamina, don' you think? We can
always fall back for now."
"You won't be able to use your
Persona if you run out of stamina.
Make sure you pace yourself."
"Hmm... Our stamina's looking a little
low. We should rest somewhere or at
least try to replenish it."
"We're in big trouble if we run out
of stamina. Don't forget that you
can always retreat if you need to."
"You're pretty low on stamina. Might
wanna head back before it's all gone."
"You've lost a lot of stamina. Maybe
it's time to head back?"
"Your stamina's low... You sure
it's okay to keep going?"
"Is your stamina okay? Make sure
you don't burn yourself out."
"You've used up a lot of stamina...
I'd say now's the time to call it."
"Hmm, they're tightening security,
huh? Let's be careful moving
forward!"
"Uh-oh, I think they're on to us.
Be more alert from now on."
"They're upping security...
We'd better watch our step."
"Looks like they're on high alert.
Try not to do anything reckless."
"This doesn't look good. We're gonna
have to retreat if we get spotted again."
"Huh? I'm picking up a lot of
activity... Looks like the enemy's
noticed us."
"The enemy's on high alert. Try
not to do anything careless!"
"This doesn't look good... We
can't afford to get spotted again!"
"No good. Security's too high.
We gotta pull out for now!"
"Security level's hit maximum! We
can't stay here anymore—fall back!"
"It doesn't look like we can open this
right now. Do you think it's because
the sercurity level is too high?"
"This treaure chest won't open right now.
Let's come back when the security level
lowers."
"It looks like it locks when the alarm
goes off. How annoying..."
"We can't get this open right now.
Guess there's a security mechanism
at work."
"Looks like the alarm triggered its
locking mechanism... How lame."
"It's no use—it won't open. We'll have
to come back when they're not on
high alert."
