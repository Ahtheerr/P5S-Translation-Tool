Nice. Now let's get stealthy.,113,20,2604,2785
"Okay. Let's do this, partner.",114,20,2791,3228
Do you finally see the truth?,115,21,34,218
Do you know the true face of the guilty?,116,21,580,784
"They condemn the good to slavery.
Pretend they do not see their agony.",117,21,830,1226
...Just as you once did.,118,21,1316,1534
But another story must begin.,119,21,1646,1848

I know what I have to do now...,126,21,5862,6012
"Condemn the evil, and hunt them down!",127,21,6186,6424
The real Phantom Thieves... would never hurt me...,128,22,368,644
The real Phantom Thieves... are my friends!,129,22,652,916

Very... high-tech.,135,23,1098,1180
"Yeah, figures it'd be another crazy one...",136,23,1186,1390
See that?,137,23,1460,1560
I'd say we just found Konoe's castle.,138,23,1896,2096
We're almost there.,139,23,2218,2338
"Only one job left, team: bring the villain to justice.",140,23,2356,2618
Some kinda card?,141,24,466,624
"Wait, that's...",142,24,706,820
Phantom Thieves?,143,24,864,945
Is it actually real?,144,24,950,1074
"Testing, one two one two...",145,24,1610,1762
"Okay, looks like we're live!",146,24,1768,1902

"You're on, man, just say it!",148,24,2130,2278
"Are you listening, Konoe?",149,24,2506,2645
"Toying with innocent lives, slandering us...",150,24,2650,2816
You've been busy. But so have we.,151,24,2834,3048
Now it's payback time.,152,24,3076,3206
"Ready or not, here we come!",153,24,3214,3346
To the villain who thinks he's a hero: Akira Konoe!,154,24,3424,3658
You stole the Desires of countless people...,155,24,3664,3840
"And tonight, we're baking them— uh, I mean, taking them—",156,24,3846,4030
"Skull, you had ONE LINE!",157,24,4035,4125
I-I meant to say that!,158,24,4130,4240
There aren't any real heroes left.,159,25,602,764
So... why not make our own?,160,25,778,994
The world needs someone willing to fight for its people's justice.,161,25,1178,1478
A hero to lead them. To unify them.,162,25,1566,1814
A hero like me.,163,25,1944,2068
And if I'm the hero... that makes YOU the villain!,164,25,2910,3198
Is that it?,165,26,766,846
So we gotta put him down one last time!,166,26,1488,1688
"Come on, Phantom Thieves.",167,26,2036,2162
Let's end this.,168,26,2268,2356
"Very soon, a deity will descend to this Earth.",169,27,36,250
"And if you're gonna get in the way, well,
I gotta put you down. Them's the breaks!",170,27,286,596
Ichinose... Why do this?,171,27,680,876
"It's kind of over your head, Sophia...",172,27,950,1123
The little failure that you are.,173,27,1129,1276
So you know who I really am?,174,27,1302,1472
"Yeah, I know.",175,27,1512,1644
Maybe this will give you a clue.,176,27,1660,1830
Voice authentication: force reset.,177,27,1835,2030

What...?,191,29,298,400
"Cool, right? It really is gorgeous.",192,29,414,646
"Sorry it had to end like this, but...
Well. What can you do?",193,29,664,1022
Phantom Thieves... It's been real.,194,29,1158,1348
Joker!,195,30,874,1050
Sophie!,196,30,1524,1650
I want my own... So please...,197,31,280,490
"I want a heart... strong enough to choose...
my own path!",198,31,644,1182
Can you wield that strength?,199,31,1194,1324
"Dare you unleash catastrophe upon this world?
Can you cling to the paltry hope that remains?",200,31,1482,1904
"Is the puppet ready to cut her own strings?
Shall the doll seize her own destiny?",201,31,1970,2378
Then you need only call my name.,202,31,2448,2606

Attention!,210,33,784,870
"You know the logo by now, right?",211,33,900,1065
We are the Phantom Thieves.,212,33,1071,1236
And we've got a big announcement for everybody!,213,33,1290,1498
Our target this time... is you!,214,33,1544,1750
"You've all been made sheep. A mechanical god has usurped
what self you had... and you let it happen.",215,33,1790,2222
"Do you really want someone telling you
what your own life is about?",216,33,2244,2496
"All of you have paths only you can take...
but you make your own choices to get there!",217,33,2526,2864
"That's why we're here.
We're going to snap you out of this!",218,33,2876,3132
You don't owe this dumb god your Desires!,219,33,3152,3366

Hey! What is that?,252,46,1052,1170
No way...,253,46,1650,1764
