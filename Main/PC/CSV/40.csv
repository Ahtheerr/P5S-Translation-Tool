"Okay, let's get to Leblanc posthaste. I wonder
how the chief's been getting along..."
"I'm exhausted from all the excitement today.
Let's call it a night and get some sleep."
"Hey, were you having trouble sleeping last
night, [1B]S1? You were tossing
and turning like crazy."
"Anyway, it's time for us to meet up with Ryuji
and buy our share of the camping equipment.
Let's head over to the Buchiko statue."
"Looks like everyone's out gathering intel
already. Let's not fall behind!"
"All right, our job's to finish up preparations for the heist while the calling card's completed."
"Once that's finished and delivered, we have to complete the heist in one fell swoop."
"Mm, Makoto's got a good point. Should we
gather everyone up?"
"Okay, let's get our supplies. What say we start
with the closest destination and head to Takemi
Medical Clinic?"
"Aw, c'mon dude... Aight, lemme know if you
change your mind."
"What are we waitin' for, then!?"
"You're gonna go right now!? I think you're a little
obsessed..."
"Man, could today have been any more
drama-packed?"
About to roll out?
"Yeah, see you later."
Not just yet.
0
"Let's head out as soon as we're ready. Make sure
you leave nothing undone."
"That a problem? Hey, if you're not
doin' anything, you should come with."
"All right, just make sure you get everything
you'll need."
"Ah, Yongen-Jaya... We may have been gone
for only half a year, but it sure brings back
memories."
"Whoa, Shibuya's as busy as ever. Look at all
the people!"
"Let's get to the Buchiko statue right away—
we don't want to leave Ryuji alone with his
attention span for too long."
Hmm... I dunno if I want all the calories...
"Doesn't seem like the statue's this way...
We should head back."
"All right. Well, here—take this with you.
Hope it does you some good on the trip."
Make sure you make enough for everyone.
"Well, time for me to pick up your ride. I'll be
right back; you give everyone a call and have
'em meet you here."
"Well, I guess I'll come along, since
[1B]S1 is here."
"It's time to square off with Alice directly. Once you think we're ready, let's infiltrate that Jail!"
0
"Check out the guy with the brown hair.
Wasn't he at Alice's thing?"
Let's do it.
I want to sniff out more rumors.
"All right, then let's go meet up at the connecting
bridge."
"Sure thing, it's your call."
"Once you're done, we should get everyone
together at the Shibuya Station's connecting
bridge and go over what we've learned."
"Should we do some sightseeing while we wait?
Though it is kinda late, I guess..."
Let's indeed.
I'm not done seeing the sights.
"Well, we solved the problem in Sapporo. The
question now is, what comes next?"
"It doesn't seem like we'll be making much
progress until Zenkichi gets back..."
"I get that. Once you're ready, let's head over
to that signing."
"At this hour, I would recommend the Ferris
wheel over in Suzushino."
Think we should head back?
I'm done for now.
Let's keep exploring.
"All right, tomorrow's the big day. Let's see
what kind of person Hyodo really is."
"All right. Let's go back to the camper when
you're done."
"Ooh, that's a good idea! You should go invite
someone to come along!"
"There's a Ferris wheel around here? That sounds
like fun! Let's do it!"
"Yo, is Gramps back yet?"
"It would be nice if we could look around the city
in the meantime... What are your plans?"
"Are you guys gonna ride the Ferris wheel
together?"
"A ride on the Ferris wheel with just the guys...
I feel like our bonds will grow stronger."
Let's do it.
I'll ask someone else.
"I heard Mari-san's questioning is going to take a
bit longer."
I rested up early for tomorrow...
Are you gonna ride the Ferris wheel with Haru?
"Oh, [1B]S1. Looks like we finally have
time to relax a little."
Are you gonna ride the Ferris wheel with Lady Ann?
Good evening. How are things?
Are you gonna ride the Ferris wheel with Makoto?
"There's nothing to do 'til Zenkichi gets back...
You got any plans?"
Are you gonna ride the Ferris wheel with Futaba?
0
It's gotten pretty late. I wonder if everyone else is still out having fun...
"We're having a celebration!? Ooh, leave it to Lady Ann! That was really thoughtful of her to invite everyone!"
"But the meet-up isn't for another hour... We've
still got a bit of time until then. What should we
do?"
"Here, take it. My treat."
It's a can of Manta...
"Just a little somethin' to start us off right.
Here's to gettin' back in action!"
"I might be a bit outta shape right now, but I'll
bounce back in no time!"
"All right, we're countin' on ya! Lemme know
when you're ready for some Jail action."
"How about visiting Tenboto? I'd enjoy seeing the
city from up high."
"Ooh, now that you mention it, yeah, we haven't gone up there yet, have we? Let's invite someone to go with us!"
"The return of the Phantom Thieves is one
thing, but never in a million years would
I have expected to actually fight Alice..."
"But we have to stop her before she's past
the point of no return."
"Let's get this taken care of so we can get on
with our summer vacation!"
"That Jail... It was eerie just how similar to the
Palaces it was."
"If it was similarly created by a human heart,
I can't help but shiver at the thought of
how that person sees the world."
Did it upset you?
We have to fix this.
I'm excited to go back.
"Actually, it's rather the opposite. To actually
bear witness to such a warped mind is very
stimulating."
"Indeed—and returning there will offer me
yet another chance to bear witness to such
mesmerizing sights."
"Ha! I could very well say the same. I must
admit, I'm quite excited to be fighting alongside
everyone once more."
"You sure do march to the beat of your own
drum, Yusuke. I'm relieved to see your
personal troubles are well behind you."
I am still rather plagued with problems...
"This suffocating heat refuses to cede my attention
and allow me to focus on my art! Even stripping
bare naked doesn't abate the intensity."
"Despite my concerns of heatstroke, I cannot
afford air conditioning. My sole saviors are tap
water and the salt stockpile I've maintained."
"But I shan't let summer defeat me. My frugality
cannot be stopped!"
"Please don't die on us, Yusuke..."
"Ah, right—I now recall your attic room also lacks
air conditioning, [1B]S1."
"Here, this could benefit you at some point.
No need to be modest."
"If you don't care to crush it up and use it with a
drink, you can even resort to licking it. May this
rock salt be the secret to our success in the Jail!"
"Man, that's a load off my shoulders. Feels like
now I can give 110% to just kickin' back and
havin' a good time."
"What's the haps, chaps? Pickin' up supplies?"
"I'm workin' on my Crowd Mode right now...
All those Shadows in the Jail were really
starting to get to me."
"I figure I'll be more used to them if I observe
their real-world versions more? Maybe? Eh,
it's worth a shot."
"Don't sweat too much getting ready! Give us
a call when it's infiltration time!"
"...You mean to say you weren't already? I would
have guessed you were in this solely for the fun
of it."
I still can't get over just how useful EMMA is.
"Just now for me, it put together an entire meal,
gave me its nutritional breakdown, and even
showed me the closest place with ingredients."
"All I had to do was ask what I should do about
dinner. Pretty easy to see why people are
such fans... "
"But then I remember that this app is what lets us
get into the Metaverse... and I get creeped out
all over again."
"Gimme a break, man, I just... Look, I just like
goin' all out, okay?"
Let's go.
Maybe not.
"Oh, [1B]S1. You busy?"
"Are you gonna go to Tenboto with Lady Ann and
the others?"
"I wanna get a picture in this cutout board before
we head out!"
"This is a great photo-op, so it'd be a real waste
not to."
"I've gone ahead and called Inari over, too, so you
should join in!"
"Oh, is it picture time?"
"What's the plan? Are you gonna hang out with
Futaba?"
Sure.
We should get going.
"Hey, thanks! Then, let's start makin' some
memories!"
"What's your hurry? Let me know if you feel like it
later, okay?"
There's a Ferris wheel!? Where at!?
"I thought I was already concerned about how
things were going in the city, but... now that
I know this is all part of some Jail?"
"And I don't even want to consider how all these
people are Shadows in that Jail..."
That does sound fun. Lead the way.
"Oh, a Ferris wheel. That sounds like fun. Shall we
go, then?"
"Huwha? They've got a Ferris wheel here!? We
gotta go!"
"A Ferris wheel...? Of course, I'd love to!"

Oof... I definitely gained weight after that...
"Okay, let's go surf the web and track down some
useful intel."
"Oh man... Easy on the road, or else it's all comin'
back up..."
"Yup. I think we can enter the Jail safely
from here."
Want to head in?
Let's go.
We're not prepared.
This'll be our third Jail. Let's not get sloppy.
"Okay. Then just come back once preparations
are made."
"Regardless, we still have some time until the
celebration. Should we head somewhere for the
time being?"
...You wanna go to Tenboto with these guys?
"Tenboto, you say? I would very much like to see
it for myself."
"Hell yeah! Let's get goin', then!"
"We were thinking of just getting some tea and
chatting to pass the time..."
"We only have time to make maybe one more
stop before the celebration."
"Great idea, [1B]S1!"
"All right, let's go together, then."
"Let's get ready for any sort of combat that
might get thrown our way. After that, it's
back to the hideout."
0
"We're not letting them arrest [1B]S1
EVER again."
"Indeed. We've no choice but to stop Alice's
rampage, but it's even more crucial that we
keep our good friend out of prison."
"Yeah—that's why we're winning this fight,
no matter what."
0
"That Inspector Hasegawa... He's not going to be
easy to deal with."
"Right, he'll jump on the first weak point he
finds. We have to watch our words and stay
on our best behavior, more so than ever."
"I'm going over the infiltration plan in my head
now. The more I rehearse it, the more confident
I feel."
"Hey, no worries, [1B]S1! You're not
getting arrested under our watch."
"We'll go take care of Alice, clear your name,
bing, bang, boom! All's well that ends well."

It's the door to the Velvet Room...
"I may need her assistance again.
I should probably go talk to her..."
"I should go to the
Velvet Room first..."
"It'll be at you-know-where. Let's celebrate for
gettin' the band back together and settin' off on
this big trip!"
Let's go.
"So, this is Mt. Aoba Park? I like it. A nice, refined
little place—it's even got a shrine."
"All right, let's go check out Date Masamune's
statue. It's supposed to be near here."
"That Ango Natsume... We may not have any
evidence of him being a Monarch yet, but he
sure is fishy."
"Let's get back to the camper. We should work
out how we want to gather intel on him, then
we can go from there."

"So we've got ourselves a mobile hideout!
Pretty convenient!"
"And I've gotta say, it sure does make the
Phantom Thieves even cooler! Nyeheheh..."
"Once you think everyone's good and ready,
let's meet at the hideout and infiltrate the Jail.
We're counting on you, [1B]S1."
"Tomorrow's our final siege on Natsume's castle.
We need to be good and ready for whatever he
may throw at us."
"Well, let's hit the RV once you're good and
ready."
"Then, the Phantom Thieves begin the search
for Gatorre Coffee."
"All right, today we storm the castle! Once we're
ready, let's move out!"
0
"Looks like everyone's headed back to the
camper. We should go too, [1B]S1."
"Next stop, Hokkaido! Time to say, ""Goodbye,
Sendai."""
"Anything you didn't tick off your list yet while
we're still here? This is your last chance."
"We've got plenty of intel now. I'd say it's safe to
call it quits."
"Remember Natsume's autograph session we
heard about? This is our chance to see him in
person. Let's do some first-party reconnaissance."
"We're getting everyone together? Okay,
I'll contact them for you."
"Thanks, Sophia. We should get over there
ourselves."

We'll know if she's a Monarch or not by entering her keyword on EMMA.
"Let's go to bed early today and be ready for
tomorrow."

"Oh, [1B]S1. Did you get my message?"
"...Um, this might seem kinda out of nowhere,
but do you like sweets?"
I'm not the biggest fan.
Love 'em.
I'm master of all sweets.
"Oh... Well, there're lots of different kinds, so you might find something you like if you keep looking."
"Really? Oh, perfect!"
"You like them that much!? Why have you never
told me!?"
"So, this really isn't a big deal or anything, but
Sendai's got these regional specialty sweets,
right?"
"I figured, since we're here, we should try as many new things as we can. Well, it turns out there's a lot more to try than I thought."
"I doubt we have enough time to get to them all.
So now I'm not sure which ones to go for..."
It looks like Lady Ann's sent you a request.
"It's not really the kind of request you'd make to
the Phantom Thieves, though..."
"But we can't let Lady A-... I mean, we can't let our friend down. We should lend her a hand!"
"Whoa, you actually bought them!"
"They all look so good... Let's split them up and
eat them as a group later!"
"...Sorry to put out such a selfish request. Sweets
just kinda brighten the mood, don't you think?"
*sigh* Did you see her smile...?
"Hey, [1B]S1! I want to see Lady Ann
smile brighter than ever before!"
I can help with that.
Sounds like a drag.
Let's make a deal.
"Hey, all right! I knew you'd understand."
"Come on, don't be like that... I need your help
here."
Sure! Anything to see Lady Ann smile!
"...Here's a thought, do you think we can find
something even more amazing than the stuff we
just got for her?"
"Even more amazing... So super amazing, then.
I've got it. Let me do a search."
"Ooh, thanks, Sophia!"
"...Sweets found. I've got hits of an extremely
limited quantity of a parfait that some have
even called ""legendary."""
Legendary!?
It's called... the Zunda Supreme Parfait.
"Perfect, Sophia! Where do we find it?"
"...Unfortunately, there aren't any details as to its
exact location. There are only reports that it's
been seen in Mt. Aoba Park."
"If it's an extremely limited quantity item, I'll bet
you can probably count the number of people
who've bought it on one hand..."
"Oh, my darling... Where did I go wrong?"
*gasp* It couldn't be...!
"Was it when we went to eat that Zunda Supreme
Parfait together?"
"Was it because I couldn't get through to that
fussy manager?"
I had no idea at the time! Who knew you needed a password for a parfait!?
"After all my frantic searching, I finally figured it
out. It's ""zunda shiro."""
"But it doesn't matter anymore, not without you
here... Oh, my sweet honey pie..."
"Hey, did you hear that?"
"It sounds like he's lost his ""honey pie.""
Regardless, ""zunda shiro"" should give us access
to our legendary dessert."
"Password...? I'm sorry, I don't know anything
about that."
"Oh, the Zunda Supreme Parfait? I saw someone
buy one at a café around here."
Ooh! We have a lead!
"Apparently, it's not on their official menu,
though. And you can't just order one, either."
You can't just order it? Is there some kind of trick?
The Zunda Supreme Parfait...?
"Oh, I think I heard one of the visitors at the
shrine mention that name."
"That said, I think the manager has to specially
acknowledge you or something..."

"This is Odori Park. It's famous for its fountain
and TV tower."
The bathhouse is in a place called Suzushino.
"It should only be a short walk away from here,
so let's get going."
"Looks like there's all kinds of people here.
Meaning there are all kinds of rumors, too."
"What we want is any kind of info that points to
Mariko Hyodo being a Monarch. Let's go."
"All right, we've gathered plenty of information."
"The situation is similar to Shibuya and Sendai.
The more we hear, the more suspicious Hyodo
becomes."
"If she's giving out her keyword during speeches
as Zenkichi says..."
Ready for bed?
Yeah.
Not yet.
I wonder what kind of speech Hyodo's gonna make tomorrow...
"Okay, but don't forget about tomorrow. Let's head back to the camper when you're done."
"It's been a wild ride, but now we're even closer
to the truth."
"Did something happen to Yusuke? We might
wanna go find him!"
"Morning, [1B]S1. Get any sleep last night?"
"Today, we breach the castle. Make sure you're
well-prepared."
The accident happened in Odori Park.
"Then let's gather at the hideout first and head
over. There should be a warden guarding the
place, if the last few times is any indication."
"Don't skimp on the prepwork, [1B]S1."
Where've you been?
"Zenkichi's gonna send out the calling card.
Let's have a meeting at the hideout once
you're ready."
"So now we're facing Hyodo herself. Be ready for
anything!"

"Man, I can't find even one Okinawa-style
soba shop..."
Will you take this seriously?
"Oh hey, sorry. I can't help but stare at that
ocean."
"Getting to take it easy in a place like this would
be so nice..."
"I heard there's even a great public beach
nearby. I hope we have time to check it out!"
"The grandeur of its profile! The dynamism of its
lines!"
Oh dear... He's totally in the zone now.
"It's hard to imagine something untoward could
be taking place on such a magnificent isle."
"I tried questioning the shopkeepers, but they
were all very evasive."
"This island isn't too large, though—we should
be able to divide up and perform a thorough
search..."
"The endless skies and ocean, the pleasant
crashing of the waves, the scent of fresh fruit
wafting along the wind..."
"This is no mere tourist attraction. This is truly
a natural paradise."
And LOOK at this Shiisaa!
"Chinsuko, umibudo, irabu... What should I get
as a souvenir?"
"Oh, I'm sorry! I should get back on track."
"I came across a group of outgoing locals,
so I asked them a few questions..."
"Once I told them I was from Tokyo, they gave
me all this produce!"
"Those are called bitter melons, or ""goya"" in
Okinawan."
"Right! The locals told me they were picked just
this morning. Look how bright they are! I bet
they're delicious."
"Perhaps we could try cooking something with
these? I'd love to watch you work your magic."
"Everyone here's so friendly and cheerful. You
really don't come across too many people like
that in the city."
"But nobody's admitted to knowing anything
about a lab on the island. Could they be less
outgoing than they seem...?"
"These are divine guardians, said to stave off
disasters. Apparently, the one on the right is
male, while the left one is female."
"Ah, so they're a couple! Good lookin' out,
Mr. and Mrs. Shiisaa!"
"OMG, Shiisaa Alert! I've never seen one in real
life!"
"Whoa, look how detailed they are from close
up! And they all have different expressions!"
"Oh, hey."
"I overheard from some deliveryman that
there's a really big building just this way."
"Wow, look at that path."
"We ought to come back here once you're done
exploring. "

I need a moment.

"Okay, I can message everyone once you're

wasn't any traffic, huh?"

"Now we're in Suzushino, which is apparently a

"I wonder why it's so crowded, though.
Everybody's talking about voting..."
"Well, no matter. Back to the bathhouse. Just go
straight for a bit, then take a right and you'll be
there."
Everyone took off...
"We should get going ourselves and see if we
can track down this research lab."
"Oh, the sun's setting... So, what should we do
next?"
Hmm?
"Wow, look at all these food vendors! This really
is the kitchen of Japan!"
"Well, Sophia? Did you find us a good entrance
to the Jail?"
"Sure did—the safest entrance is near Tenboto
in Shinsekai."
Looks like we've reached Shinsekai.
"Look at the fish swimming through the air!
And that big, gleaming statue! What purpose
could they serve?"
"What an interesting place! Looks like there's
a ton of stores to check out, too."
"And what's with that crowd? Are they trying to
get at that statue?"

"There you are, [1B]S1."
"Hmm? What's wrong, [1B]S1?
Did you ""zone out""?"
"The safest entry point of the Jail is near
Tenboto. Let's go."
"Hmm, based on the voices, it's pretty clear
we're headed to Konoe's childhood home..."
Zenkichi's tracking the address down now.
"Considering what we've seen so far, we're
probably going to run across a warden there."
"Let's make sure we're as ready as we can be,
then meet up with Zenkichi at the hideout."

"Ah, you're here for the Zunda Supreme Parfait?
Then, please provide the password."
"All right, [1B]S1! Let her have it!"
"...My, excitable little kitty, isn't he?"
I gave the manager the password...
...Excellent.
"""Zunda shiro"" is a legendary type of soybean,
born from many years of selective breeding.
That is the meaning of the password."
"Oh...? Looking closer, I can see that you have the
eyes of a true hunter, and one who always
ensnares his sweet, sweet prey."
"Those glasses can't hide your passion for sweets
from me. No, sir."
"...Very well. The Zunda Supreme Parfait is yours
to purchase."
"Wow! You did it, [1B]S1!"
"Do we just buy it at the counter? C'mon, let's not waste any time!"

"There's nothing more we can do now.
We should wait at the hideout until
Zenkichi reaches out."
"Osaka's known for lots of things, but laughter is
definitely one of them."

"Hey, there you are."
"Y'know how we got our fight with Konoe pretty
soon? I went out and got us a little something
to pump us up."
It's some kinda white powder...
"Yeah, I heard it's high-quality shit! One little taste, and you're totally hooked!"
"H-Hang on, Ryuji! You don't want people
getting the wrong idea..."
"The hell are you talking about? This is
okonomiyaki mix, dude."
"Takoyaki's good and all, but okonomiyaki's
where it's at."
"Seein' as we're comin' up on the big finale,
I figured we oughta get ourselves energized."
"We'll smack the living piss outta that smug-faced
bastard!"
"People sometimes jump off this thing during big
celebrations and stuff, right?"
"Whoa! It's a lot higher than I thought! No one
gets hurt doing this?"
"My, look at that, [1B]S1."
That is a Japanese puffer fish. You might even call it the Monarch of all puffer fish.
"In that case, that fish is our enemy!"
"Look what I got! Cute, huh?"
It's a giant takoyaki pillow...
"Interesting. People in Osaka must really know
how to make a sale... Or do they?"
"Everyone's spreading rumors about us... We're
totally the bad guys here."
"They said they'd gimme a good deal, so I kinda
just bought it on the spot... "
"It's got that regional flair to it, plus I thought
it'd be nice for whenever we're hanging at
the hideout."
"We've died and gone to Osaka eats heaven! I'm
gonna have a field day stockin' up for the road."

"Sadly, I've already exhausted my traveling funds... Is this truly the end?"

"Yusuke seems really sad... I want to be useful.
Think you could help me out, [1B]S1?"
"I looked up the ingredients for skewers. All we
need to do is gather them and cook some for
him."
"Farewell, my sweet pork katsu, beef katsu,
scallop, shrimp, and red ginger combo!"

"You know, now that I think about it, I've been
walking around places I've never been all by
myself..."
"I asked a lady for directions, AND I talked to a guy selling takoyaki!"
You've really grown up.
That's the power of Osaka.
"Heheh... I'm not the same ol' Futaba anymore, you know."
"Yeah! People here are suuuper friendly! It's
doing wonders for my charisma stats."
"Maybe I should try navigating in an Osaka
dialect? Movin' and groovin', Joker! That's muh
boy!"
"Look how carefully he's flipping the takoyaki...
I could watch this all day!"
"...But we're not here for that, are we?"
"I think we're close to the end of the Jail. Let's
keep giving it our best."
"A lot of people like to rub his feet and make a
wish..."
Everyone has a wish of their own. And I just can't forgive someone who'd take advantage of that.
"This latest Jail really gives off that ""final dungeon""
kinda feel. Prolly 'cause we're goin' up against
the head honcho."
"A Billiken keychain? Man, if this thing were
actually lucky, we'd be living easy..."
"How am I supposed to know what middle
schoolers like...? Damn, I've got no clue."
Whoa! When'd you get here!?
*sigh* Maybe Sakura'll have some ideas...
But we're almost there. I know we can do it!
"You out getting supplies? Nice knowin' the boss
pulls his own weight."

"If we can't get any more info online, then we'll
just have to ask around at the park."

and see if we can learn anything."
"Thanks, Sophia!"

"Well, good job getting packed up for the trip."
"Anything else you think we'll need? If so, we'd
better go buy it now. "
"Once we're all set, we should go say our
goodbyes to the chief before heading out."
I'm not done getting ready. Perhaps I should hold off on heading out a bit longer...
"Her medicine sure worked wonders for us
before—I'd feel way more reassured if we
took some with us this time too."
"Let's make sure that we're ready for anything. After that, we can send out the calling card from the good ol' hideout!"

"Thank you for holding up your end of the deal.

"But, soon, our deal will come to an end..."
"Once summer vacation's over... everyone
has to go back to their regular
lives, right, [1B]S1?"
"Why not speak with them one last time while
we're still here?"
"It could be your last chance to share any
special memories of the trip."
"After all, once we depart from here, we'll be
on the road back to Tokyo."
"Were you able to find everyone you hoped to
speak with tonight?"
"Yep, good to go."
"Actually, just a second..."
Okay. I'll ask everyone to meet us here.
"Roger that. Make sure to conclude all business
here before we depart."
"Hold on, the camper's not this way."

"I can't wait a moment longer! We must make for
the Jail immediately, [1B]S1!"
"Should I cross swords with that Shadow even
once more, I'm certain I will glean truth from
the encounter."
"I'll send you my request via smartphone, so
please, let us take our leave without wait."
"The strength and delight in their
expressions... What charming little
fellows."
"You know, their size makes them perfect for
display in the RV."
"It appears we've begun amassing quite the
collection—with cherished memories to match."

overheated or anything..."
"Iwai's shop is just up ahead. Let's get you
inside, pronto."
"I've got it! [1B]S1, can I summon

I just had a great idea.

"Ah, [1B]S1. You've come."
"The azure sky, the crystalline ocean,
the caressing wind..."
"Simply standing still in this spot alone provides
an endless flow of artistic inspiration."
How about a Shiisaa?
How about some rafute?
How about the utaki?
"Aha, rafute, you say! While pork belly braised
in alcohol and soy sauce is very tempting as a
subject, I worry it'd be too tempting a meal..."
"Hmmm... Is there any beauty that could quench
my burning passion?"
"I see, the revered area of the beach. However,
I cannot bring myself to enter such a restricted
area against the wishes of the locals."
"Hmmm... Is there any beauty that could quench
my burning passion?"
"That's right! The Shiisaa is most integral to
Okinawa!"
"Perhaps I should go and sketch the statues we
saw by the dock? No, that won't be enough..."
"I wish to capture one that is larger than life,
the perfect balance of grand fury and impish
delight."
"...As I recall, there were Shiisaa in the Jail here."
Yes... Yes! That's it!
"I've finally completed a wholly satisfactory
sketch during our time here, and it's entirely
thanks to you, [1B]S1."
"I have an idea—here, please accept this gift
as my personal thanks."
"An elderly artist who said he's been crafting
Shiisaa for over 50 years passed by here only
a moment ago..."
"He said he sensed something from my Shiisaa
sketch, and told me I absolutely had to accept
a pair of his figurines."
"Oh, [1B]S1. Could I consult you on
something?"
"So... You might think this is a bit childish, but..."
"Since we're at the beach and all, I think... I'd like
to try suikawari. You know, the game where you
split a watermelon while blindfolded and dizzy?"
"Hey, why not?"
"Really, of all things?"
That's sounds fun.
Really!?
"It's not like my family ever took a day at the
beach together, so I didn't actually get to do
it growing up..."
"Once you've split enough Shadows,
a watermelon won't affect your nerves
at all."
"Splitting a watermelon? That sounds fun.
I would like to watch."
"Thanks, Sophia. I'm happy to hear that."
"And I'm happy to help with preparations, if
you'd like. You will need one watermelon,
and..."
"Um... I don't usually split them, but a warm-up
does sound like a good idea."
"Maybe I should file a request before I go pick up
a watermelon."
"Whoa, look at this watermelon!"
"Looks like I've got my hands full, all right. Now
I need to make sure I can crack it open cleanly
so everyone can have some."
"Care to get started? Oh—but, what about the
stick?"
"Well, when I was in the Jail, I realized
something."
"Rather than wield a weapon I'm not as
familiar with, like a stick, I figured my
fist might give us better results..."
"And now I'm nice and warmed up, thanks to
that Jail excursion. I feel like I could split it
right down the middle now!"
So bold...
"If I manage to break it into acceptable pieces,
would you help me pass them out to the rest
of the group?"
"Of course, you can claim the best piece first,
[1B]S1."
"After all, you put the most effort into helping
with my request."

"Oh man, my sides still hurt! Wasn't Gramps the
most hilarious Venus you ever saw?"
"What's that? You want me to show you those
detainment techniques again?"
"No no no! No, please!"
"Sheesh, I can't believe you damn kids. Got
anything to say for yourself?"
It was all Yusuke's idea.
Let's try a different statue now.
Sor-ry...
Right! All we did was watch.
"Hey, he's YOUR friend! And don't act like you
couldn't do anything about it!"
"Hell no! I'm not some little kid you can just
talk into doing whatever!"
"I sure hope I'm just imagining it, but that
didn't sound very sincere to me..."
"Well, the sun's about to set. We should wrap up
the rowdiness and get on dinner pretty soon."
"Ahhh, that was great! I think I laughed enough
for two lifetimes."
Oh yeah! I found this really pretty shell earlier.
"I thought I could string it onto a necklace as a
little souvenir for myself..."
"But it turned out so nice, I want you to have it
instead!"
"Maybe I should make one for everyone else?
I'm gonna go look for more shells."
"Man, nothing beats the beach! I'm so glad
we had a great time here, even if I don't get
another chance this summer!"
I hope Zenkichi-san isn't too upset with us...
"Anyway, today has reminded me a lot of our
time at the beach last year."
"Ah yes, our trip with Futaba—as well as our
time in Hawaii, on your school trip."
"It was pretty soon after that Hawaii trip that I
got to know you all."
"I never could've imagined we'd all share an RV
as we traveled cross-country on a mission."
Has it really been a whole year?
I wonder where we'll be in another 365 days...
On another trip.
On the path of adulthood.
Hopefully still in touch...
"Aw, that sounds so nice! Why don't we do
something like this every summer?"
"I suppose the list of must-see destinations is
neverending, and we've only checked off a
precious few so far."
"True—I can tell everyone's grown in a lot of
different ways, despite only being apart for
half a year."
"I kept assuming the adult life was far down
the road for us, but maybe it's closer than
I thought."
"No need for such concern. I vow, here and
now, to never miss a single payment on my
cell phone bill."
"I see... Well, good for you, I suppose."
"And there's no need to worry if we do ever
lose touch—we'll all just come over and visit
in person."
"What'd you think of ocean life, Sophia?"
"There were so many fish! And shells and coral
of all different colors, and patterns of light
waving and shimmering through the water!"
"Ooh, how neat! Glad to hear ya liked it."
"Ya know, everyone took me on a special trip
to the beach last year."
"I'll remember that day for the rest of my life.
It's when I first joined the Phantom Thieves. "
"That does sound like it would make for a very
memorable day."
"I've got it—I'll commit today to my own memory.
That way, I can cherish it forever."
"Welp, is it time for us to transform from Beach
Mode to Barbecue Mode? I'm lookin' forward
to it!"
"""No entry beyond this point""?"
"Well, if that's not suspicious... But, do you think
it has anything to do with the research lab?"
"With the sun setting soon, going alone may be
overly risky."
"Gah, my back is killing me! I shoulda been
takin' it easier today..."
"I'm gonna go lie down. You kids clearly have
enough energy to handle the dinner prep."
"...Here, take this. Go buy yourself a soda or
something."

"This trip has been ridiculous... I swear I lost at
least a few years of my life just from this island!"
Not just yet.
"*sigh* We came all the way to Okinawa and did
next to nothing besides getting hunted down
both in AND outside a Jail."
"I just wanted to kick back at a nice seaside spa,
treat myself to some of the local eats..."
"Heheh, I had a feeling you'd say that—soooo,
I bouuught... this!"
"What's that? ""Pork/egg onigiri""?"
"It's a type of rice ball, made of sliced luncheon
meat and egg sandwiched between rice and
seaweed."
"It's considered Okinawan soul food. Many have
said, ""If you haven't eaten one of those yet, you
haven't been to Okinawa!"""
"Wow, it's that big a deal!?"
"Yeah, it's their thing here. I got enough for
everyone."
"Aw, thanks, Ryuji! You're a real pal!"
"Oh sh—! I, uh... forgot to get you one."
YOU WHAT!?
"Here, you can have half of mine! Just don't be
pissed! Please, Morgana, I didn't mean to..."
Hmph!

"Yes, the area once known as ""the Land of Fire""—
for good reason. A volcanic treasure... Perhaps
that means a trip to the hot springs is in order?"
"Whatever the case may be, I look forward to
our arrival. Hopefully we will continue to enjoy
our excursion together."
"Although, now that I think about it, we must
also prepare ourselves for the possibility that
we'll encounter a Jail along our route."

"Farewell, Okinawa... I'll remember your

"Next up is Kyushu, correct? If memory serves
me correctly, that island is known for..."
Pork ramen.
The beautiful ladies.
Their active volcano.
"Just as I thought—and such a thought is
beginning to affect my stomach..."
"Yes, that's it. One of the three cities considered
a national hotspot of aesthetically-pleasing
faces is found there. Careful, [1B]S1."
"Zenkichi-san said he was heading back to his
HQ in Kyoto..."
"Tailing us in Tokyo, all the way to Hokkaido,
then taking us on a ferry to Okinawa, just to
go all the way to Kyoto at the drop of a hat?"
"There doesn't seem to be a moment's rest for
a Public Security inspector."
"I wonder if I should let Akane-chan know her
father's on his way home..."
"I keep wondering who's the real mastermind
behind all of this business."
"Why would anyone want to do this to people?
Especially now that we know multiple deaths
are involved..."
"I hope we find a strong lead soon—and that
the police's search of the lab goes in our favor."
"Farewell, Okinawa! Our time together may have
been short, but it was sweet."
"Awwww, I just realized I didn't get to try
goya chanpuru. It's, like, the staple dish
of Okinawa!"
"Know what? You should make some for us,
[1B]S1! I bet you'd be great at it!"
"Here, I even found a recipe you can use.
C'mon, Chanpuru Champ!"
"Here, I even found a recipe you can use.

celebrated in July?"
"It looks like Tanabata is observed using the old
lunar calendar, so the festival is held a month

"Apparently it's even affecting some of the

that it's getting bad for business."
"People no-call, no-showing or even ditching
their shifts partway through to go pick up more
copies of Natsume's book..."
Could their hearts have been changed?
"Oh, I nearly forgot..."
"When I told one of the local restaurant owners
that I was on a trip with my friends, he gave me
this."
"It's a hamburger from a local chain, using only
local ingredients. They said it's very good."
"I hope Okumura Foods can be a good
representative of regional flavors as
well one day."
"The store owners were real surprised to learn
who Haru's family is."
"At first they were all stiff and nervous, but
Haru's too warm for anyone to keep that
up long! She had 'em singin' in no time."
"It was crazy seeing how people treat the upper
crust, let alone Haru's ability to get 'em to stop!
She is so amazing..."
"Hey, ain't this pretty sick?"
"It's a keychain of
a little katana..."
"I can't stop myself from buyin' this kinda stuff.
I feel like I just gotta, bein' a dude and all."
"My mom'll probably be pissed, tellin' me I
wasted my money, but ya know what? I say
stuff like this makes the best souvenirs."
That's really sick.
You're such a child.
I get ya.
Ha! I knew it! I knew you'd agree. In fact...
"Really? Even old dudes think katanas are pretty
cool, though..."
"Maybe you'll change your mind if you get
one of your own. In fact..."
"Yeah!? I mean, they're pretty cheap, but they
hold up all right, and they build all sorts of cool
lil' gimmicks in 'em! In fact..."
"This thing splits into two halves. How's about
we divvy it up?"
"Here, you take the katana half, I'll take the
dragon hilt half!"
Hang onto that—I bet it'll be good luck.
"Zunda mochi... Zunda milkshake... Ooh, zunda
parfait! Zunda cake..."
It all looks sooo good! I can't wait to dig in!

huge crowd."
"In fact, she was so preoccupied that she ending
up tripping and dropping her candied apple."
"She was about a hair away from just bursting
into tears... To this day, that's the only time
I've ever seen that look on her face."
"I felt so bad—I ended up splitting my chocolate
banana with her. That really takes me back..."
"Oh! Keep that between you and me though,
okay? I don't want Sis trying to get even."
"Even in this seemingly peaceful city, countless
people have had their hearts changed... "
"What a terrifying power that is, when you really
think about it. We have to make sure we never
misuse it. "

"Sometimes, I wonder..."
"Can true beauty exist without the value and
praise provided by society?"
I don't know...
Perhaps; perhaps not.
"Well, the ""Sayuri"" is beautiful."

answer so valuable."
"Indeed. Some say beauty is a concept built by
societal values, while others believe it is an
inherent aspect."
"Thank you, [1B]S1."

ice cream that also sells chocolate bananas!

"All right, sorry about that. I should get back

"Hey, good timing!"
"I want some curry before we hit up the Jail.
Good luck curry, let's call it."
Good luck curry?
"Oh, make it yourself."
Isn't katsu the lucky food?
"You know, like in ancient warrior times, they'd
all sit around and eat curry together before
marching into battle? Or something like that?"
"Not gonna happen. You and Sojiro are the
curry chefs—I'm only an expert at eating it."
"Okay, katsu curry may technically be the true
lucky food, but... we're gonna abbreviate it!
Yeah, cause we're short on time."
"I know we just had some a little while ago, but
my reserves are runnin' low! I can't help it."
"And we're about to go into a Jail... I need
a curry power-up, and only yours will do,
[1B]S1!"
"Buuuut this was the only ingredient I could
scrounge up. Good luck finding the rest!"
"*sigh* Well, I guess we've got an order up,
[1B]S1."
"If you don't have the ingredients, you'll need
to pick some up first—then you can cook at the

probably taking the form of someone from
Natsume's cognition—at least, that's my guess."
"In other words, there's a good chance that
person exists somewhere in the real world.
Some kind of acquaintance to Natsume."
"You mean I might actually run into that guy
somewhere around here!? Now I'm REAL
skeezed out..."

that clears my head."

"One must admit, he has his own personal style.
With some effort, he could certainly shine as a
writer..."
"Sorry, I oughtn't ponder such details now.
People's Desires are at stake."
Yusuke seems very concerned for Natsume.
"Natsume disrespected something important
to Yusuke, which upset him quite clearly."
"So, why the concern? I don't understand."
"Clinging to false glory won't shield him from
the truth forever."
"Please, Lord Masamune, watch over us as we
expose Natsume for the fraud he is."
Yusuke really is serious about this...

"Apparently, that building's got an observation
deck—I bet the view at night is a-MA-zing!"
"Natsume's probably got one on his castle,
too. I can just imagine him looking down
at us from one..."
"""Foolish adventurers! Such shallow minds are
NO match for me! Muahahahahaaa!"""
"In a way, I've gotta respect his commitment
to the bit. I have a feeling we're gonna have
to hit him with everything we've got!"
0
"So we finally made it to the castle. That's, like,
the last place before a boss fight in most video
games, right?"
"*gasp* Ya think that means we're gonna get our
hands on some epic-ass loot!?"
"It ain't exactly like in the stories, but we're
really goin' at it like a big party of fantasy
heroes. Never thought that'd happen..."
"But I guess it's somethin' we all wanna do at
some point or other in our lives. Swingin' a big
sword, shootin' magic beams, fightin' evil..."

"*sigh* It's another hot one. I wish I had
something I could use to block the sun..."
"By the way, are you thirsty?"
"When I bought a drink from the vending
machine, it dropped a second one for free."
"I've never heard of them before—the design's
pretty cute, though."
"Lemme see... ""Mootiful Zunda Soda""?"
"""Refreshing soda infused with the creaminess
of milk and the sweet, salty taste of famous
Sendai zunda!"""
"""Take a swig and enter a Mootiful new world!
Beloved beverage of Date Masamune himself,""
the bottle claims."
"Yeah, that sounds like kind of a reach. The
description didn't sell me on it at all, either."
"Wait. Zunda, soda... and MILK? It's called
what now!?"

"I think everyone's holding up to the heat
for now..."
"But we ought to keep ourselves properly
hydrated and energized so we don't get
worn out."
"I remember seeing a lot of local foods and
drinks being sold over at Sendai Station."
"Perhaps you could pick up some healthy snacks,
or even something for your cooking repertoire?"

"Yo—I'm thinkin' of hittin' up a ramen joint
before we roll out."
"Apparently, Sendai's all about the spicy miso
ramen—can you believe I never heard of it that
way before the trip?"
"You should grab one last bowl for yourself if
you think you'll miss it!"
"Man, do we really hafta leave already? We were
so busy, I feel like we barely got to do anything
here..."
"I'm definitely lookin' forward to our next stop,
though—Sapporo is THE place for ramen!"

"All the signs and posters of Natsume are already
gone. It's like he was never here."
"I wonder if that means he never actually had
anyone in his corner..."
"That is not the case. I've found a number of
posts online where people are supportive of
Natsume."
"Oh! In that case, I think he'll make it just fine
in the end."
"Who knows, maybe he'll publish another book
at some point? I'd be willing to give it a read."
"...Although, on second thought, I'm not so
great with print. Think I'd still be supportive
if I waited for the movie version to come out?"

"Look, [1B]S1."
It's a Tanabata decoration...
"It may be a standard tourist souvenir, but I find
it still has a certain elegant charm."
"Apparently, these festival decorations are not
solely for display—individuals may write down
their own wishes and tie them to the branches."
"Common wishes include the happiness and
success of family and loved ones."
I see...
"What say we display this one in the RV,
[1B]S1?"
"Considering how wishes and desires are
one in the same, it would make a rather
fitting souvenir for our trip."
"Money, power, fame—these are what warp
a person's true desires."
"That is what makes staying true to one's heart
so important."

I had a great time at the festival yesterday.
"In fact, I haven't had that much fun in a good,
long while. And all of the food was great!"
"I noticed everyone gorging themselves more
than usual. Was the food especially delicious?"
"Well, it was good, but I think it was the lively
atmosphere that made it so easy to get a little
wild."
"The dazzling lights, the colorful decorations,
the roar of the drums and the crowd, my head
buzzing from all the laughing..."
"All of these things came together to make
a once-in-a-lifetime moment."
Got it. Fun things make for special memories.
"This is the last we'll see of the Tanabata
decorations for the year. We should take
a lot of pictures!"

Next up is Hokkaido.
"Make sure you've taken care of all your last-
minute shopping and sightseeing."
"If you'd like, you could even train for a bit in
the Jail. A little workout before a long car ride
can do wonders."

"This Kuon Ichinose seems like a pretty big
name in the AI field."
"So, she's a computer expert who can apparently
blow off the whole world around her during a
rant..."
"The verdict of an ex-shut-in? Sounds like she
might not be the most social butterfly in the
garden."
"Well, don't worry. She's got a whole bunch of
new friends now—with plenty of experience
breaking through to people!"
"Hey, don't sell the power of social anxiety short!
Although, I will say, a fellow geek is easier than
anyone else for me to talk to!"
"She's gonna do the Phantom Thieves a world
of good, so we should just let her do her thing
for now while we get to Hokkaido."
"Did you know TWO MILLION PEOPLE come to
the Tanabata here in Sendai every year!?"
"After those crowds we saw yesterday, I buy it!
Man, can you imagine if we came here last
year? I'da been KO'd in an instant."
"But now? I can even go souvenir shopping all
on my own, no problem. "
"I mean... Yeah, it's because I know you're all
here nearby, but still!"
"By the time this trip's over, I'll be strollin'
through the crowds all by myself, whistlin'
a little tune!"
"And then, you shall cower at my might! Muahaha!"

Hunt for one later.
"A Zunda Supreme Parfait!? You guys really got
this for me...!?"
Oh my gosh! It's beautiful! And it looks so good! I'm freaking out over here!
"All in a day's work, so long as it means seeing
Lady Ann smile. Right, [1B]S1!?"
"Morgana... [1B]S1...! Aw, you guys are
the best!"
"Meowhehe... Lady Ann's smile's as radiant as the
sun!"
"[1B]S1, Sophia, thanks. I couldn't have
done it without you two."
"Morgana's smiling too now. I'm glad I was able
to help."
"Hey, why don't we all eat it together? You guys
went through all that trouble, after all!"
"Aww, Lady Ann's so considerate! How can we say no!?"
"Uhhh, yeah, I was! I was totally gonna question
some soba shop staff!"
"Oh, [1B]S1. Could I consult you on
something?"
"So... You might think this is a bit childish, but..."
"Since we're at the beach and all, I think... I'd like
to try suikawari. You know, the game where you
split a watermelon while blindfolded and dizzy?"
"Hey, why not?"
"Really, of all things?"
That's sounds fun.
Really!?
Really!?
"It's not like my family ever took a day at the
beach together, so I didn't actually get to do
it growing up..."
"Um... I don't usually split them, but a warm-up
does sound like a good idea."
"Splitting a watermelon? That sounds fun.
I would like to watch."
"Yeah, Sophia? I'm happy to hear that."
"And I'm happy to help with preparations, if
you'd like. You will need one watermelon,
and..."
"Maybe I should file a request before I go pick up
a watermelon."
"When the time comes, I'll be awaiting a serving
of your legendary curry, [1B]S1."
"*giggle* Yes, your curry recipe is the one thing
I hope never changes."
"The sun'll be setting soon. Should we start
getting dinner ready? "
"That's true. Should we call everyone else over,
then?"
Sure.
"Okay, I'll contact everyone."
"Having too good a time with just us, huh?
Well, let's meet up with the others at this
spot when you're ready."

"Hahah, I figured you'd say that. Can't say I'd ever picture you flashin' a badge."
"Heh, is that right? Well, when that day comes,
I'll be the one givin' the orders, ya hear?"
"...You guys helped me find something I'd lost a
long time ago."
"If, later on down the road, you find you're in a
similar place and don't know what to do... Well,
just lemme know."
I'll be the man I should've been back then.

coffee?"
"Ooh, that smells super good! Our hideout
suddenly turned into Leblanc!"
"Mewhehehe... Makes me feel so warm and cozy.

heart."
"It seems the coffee I made is a hit...
I should finish up the rest later."

"Such exquisite flavor... This stew is
restaurant-quality and then some."
"To think you'd succeed in recreating it...
No wonder you're our leader, [1B]S1."
"He stole that special taste like a true phantom
thief! Let's add even more recipes to our
repertoire!"
"It's more for our nutrition than our reputation,
though."
"I'll aim to match that restaurant's flavor as much
as possible... Maybe I should eat the leftovers later."
Wow... This really is delicious.
"I have to agree. It might even be tastier than
when I've had it at a restaurant. More aromatic,
too."
"People get these for lunch all the time, right?
I've seen 'em all boxed up, but I never actually
had one ready-made."
"It's such a luxury to enjoy it freshly cooked.
Thanks, [1B]S1."
"It seems the salmon bowl was a big hit.
Maybe I should eat the leftovers later..."
"Mmm, the noodles have just the right firmness!
The miso flavor tastes great too!"
"Holy shit, this is good... It's like an out-of-body
experience!"
"Hey... [1B]S1... Would ya make
this for me every morning?"
"Are you proposing to him, Ryuji?"
"It seems the miso ramen was a big hit...
Maybe I should eat the leftovers later."
"The lamb meat is a hint gamey, yet it forms a
perfect harmony with the lightly sweet
vegetables... This is truly magnificent!"
"Plus, isn't jingisukan supposed to be healthy?
Not only that, the taste is out of this world!
Doesn't get much better than this."
"Call me over when you decide to cook this
again. Don't worry, I'd be happy just to taste
test."
"Hey, don't leave me out of this! I want a taste
test too!"
"It seems the jingisukan was a big hit...
Maybe I should eat the leftovers later."
"Mmph! *chomp* Sho good! The tuna and
salmon literally melt in your mouth!"
"You look so happy, Lady Ann... Just being able to
see you like this is more than enough for me."
"Oh, then can I have yours, too?"
"Ahh! Please, not that!"
"It seems the seafood bowl was a big hit...
Maybe I should eat the leftovers later."
Mmmm! This Okinawa soba's soooo gooood!
"The clear, savory broth goes perfectly with the fat-speckled meat... It's impossible to stop eating!"
......
"Huh? What's wrong, Ryuji? You're not gonna
eat?"
"Nah, it's just... It's called ""Okinawa"" soba, so
I thought it's better to eat it somewhere hot
and sunny, with sweat runnin' down my face!"
Know what? I'm gonna go eat outside!
"Ooh, so this is what real chanpuru is!"
"Thanks, [1B]S1! Ippemasan!"
"Ippemasan: an Okinawan phrase that means
""extremely delicious."""
"You're getting pretty used to explaining things
to us, Sophia."
"But she's right, the goya is very delicious!"
I want to get Sojiro to try this ASAP.
"It seems the goya chanpuru was a big hit...
Maybe I should eat the leftovers later."
Hrgh!? What's this noxious odor!?
"Oh, it's the goat soup we ate the other day.
The smell does linger for quite a while, though."
"Regardless, it's still delicious, and it goes down
surprisingly smooth."
"Though the smell is indeed strong, the taste is
rather mellow. I wouldn't mind starting every
day with a heaping, healthy portion."
...Please don't.
"The goat soup seemed all right...
Maybe I should eat the leftovers later."
"I'm amazed you were able to capture the
essence of Kyoto home cooking in each
of these small dishes. This is wonderful."
"We made this with Zenkichi the other day, right?
But wow, these flavors... Are you secretly a head
chef somewhere?"
Maybe you should be!
"It seems the obanzai was a big hit...
Maybe I should eat the leftovers later."
Damn that's good! Okonomiyaki's the best!
"It really is tasty. Could it be because we made
this ourselves?"
"It's easy to make AND it tastes great? I seriously
could eat this every day."
"The ingredients are cost-effective as well.
It seems I've overlooked this dish, much to
the detriment of my appetite."
"It seems the okonomiyaki was a big hit...
Maybe I should eat the leftovers later."
"Gosh, this is incredible!"
"Isn't this from the place with the giant crab out
front? Gotta say, it's a damn good recreation."
"Yes, the soup really draws out the true flavor of
the crab. It has an excellent taste."
......
"Yeah, I figured he'd lose it over this."
"It seems the crab hot pot was a big hit...
Maybe I should eat the leftovers later."
"The pressed sushi they feature in Osaka is quite
striking, each layer more beautiful than the last!"
"Mm, and the egg tastes great too! I don't even
need soy sauce for this!"
"Let me have some! At least gimme a full piece of
crab!"
"It seems the Osaka sushi was a big hit...
Maybe I should eat the leftovers later."
Could... Could it be...?
"Is this the full course of kushikatsu I had
abandoned all hope of eating? And...
you made it just for me?"
"Thank you, [1B]S1. You are truly
a saint among men. I will never forget your
kindness."
"Is Yusuke crying again? Well, at least they're
happy tears."
"It seems the kushikatsu was a big hit...
Maybe I should eat the leftovers later."
"Dude... This tastes INSANELY good! How'd you
do it!?"
"This is still Leblanc curry, true to the original,
but it's like its stats are all maxed out!"
"Have you finally mastered it!? You're on another
level, [1B]S1!"
"It seems the curry was a big hit...
Maybe I should eat the leftovers later."
"Such deep, bold flavor... and a pleasant aroma
on top of it... [1B]S1-kun, this is amazing!"
"I always thought it tasted great, but never this
good!"
"My, [1B]S1, you've grown into a
fine young man. Perhaps I can finally retire as
your master and live a peaceful life in the hills..."
"Were you practicing in secret or something?
Either way, you'd make the chief proud."
"It seems the coffee was a big hit...
Maybe I should finish the rest later."
"Oh, I remember this. It's the curry we made at
Zenkichi-san's place... The Kyoto-farmed
veggies really do add flavor, don't they?"
"Oh yeah, Akane was super-stoked about it, huh?"
"Why don't you teach Zenkichi how to make it
sometime? Then we can have him cook it for her!"
"It seems the curry was a big hit...
Maybe I should eat the leftovers later."
Whoa! That is one mammoth chunk of meat!
...Wow. This man's a ramen buffoon.
"It seems the Okinawa soba was a big hit...
Maybe I should eat the leftovers later."
"And you're gonna cut it in front of us!? Man...
This is just too good!"
...Dude. I am losin' my mind right now!
"It has just the right amount of salt, and the meat
is charred to perfection. You brought the true
flavor of the meat out wonderfully."
"It's said that the simpler the dish, the more you
can taste the chef's skills. But to think it'd be this
apparent..."
"Mewhehe, looks like they're gobbling it up.
Impressive, [1B]S1!"
"It seems the churrasco was a big hit...
Maybe I should eat the leftovers later."
"Something smells delicious...
Maybe I should sit down and try it."
Wait.
"Are you planning on ordering gyutan stew?
Then allow me to join you."
"I hear that beef tongue when softened in stew
is simply divine. I must confirm this for myself."
I enjoyed eating gyutan stew with Yusuke...
"Superb... Truly superb, [1B]S1!"
I feel a flash of inspiration...
"Something smells delicious...
Maybe I should sit down and try it."
"You know, I've been curious about this place.
It smells so good here, even from outside."
"Beef tongue is probably the most well-known
specialty in Sendai, but salmon bowls seem to
be popular as well."
"If it's all right with you, why don't we try it out
together? Better than eating alone, right?"
I enjoyed eating salmon bowls with Haru...
"Mmm, this was definitely the right choice!
There's no way simmering salmon with rice
wouldn't turn out delicious!"
I feel a flash of inspiration...
"Something smells delicious...
Maybe I should sit down and try it."
"Oh hey, you're eating here too? Then let's sit
together, dude."
"Mm, good stuff! When you're in Sapporo, you
gotta get miso ramen!"
"Scuse me, could I get another order of chashu?
Actually, make that two—one for me and one for
this guy!"
I enjoyed miso ramen with Ryuji...
I feel a flash of inspiration...
"Something smells delicious...
Maybe I should sit down and try it."
"Hold it right there, [1B]S1!
Don't tell me you plan on eating here
all by yourself?"
"Jingisukan's a party food—you know, for people
with social lives? They'll all sit around a pot of
searing lamb, laughing at some inside joke..."
"I bet you everybody in there is cracking up as we
speak... And if you walked in there without a
group, they'd start cracking up at YOU!"
"Yet you still dare to enter!? Are you a hero
on a mission or something?"
"Then... Then I'll assist you! It's only natural to
team up in these situations, right!?"
I enjoyed jingisukan with Futaba...
I feel a flash of inspiration...
"This seafood bowl looks delicious...
Maybe I should sit down and try it."
"Oh, are you out grabbing food too,
[1B]S1? Doesn't the seafood
bowl here look amazing?"
"I'm thinking I should try that. Just look at all the
raw fish they use. "
"And don't worry, Morgana, I'll buy one to-go
for you."
"Ooh, how thoughtful, Makoto! Can't thank you
enough!"
I enjoyed seafood bowls with Makoto...
I feel a flash of inspiration...
"Something smells delicious...
Maybe I should sit down and try it."
"Heheh, was waitin' for ya, [1B]S1.
Obviously we gotta eat Okinawa soba while
we're here!"
"I mean, I've had some already, but I could
easily down another bowl with ya."
"When you add in all this... uh... kore-juice-u?
Whatever, the chili stuff. Anyway, I could eat
a ton o' this—"
Blugh! I put way too much...
I enjoyed Okinawa soba with Ryuji...
I feel a flash of inspiration...
"A distinct smell is wafting out from here...
Maybe I should try eating whatever it is."
"Say, would you mind if I joined you? I've been
curious about this goat soup..."
"I've read that it's very nutritious and energizing,
despite its unusual flavor. So I've been meaning
to try it for a while now."
"But wow, this really does smell... interesting.
Looks like I may have to brace myself."
"All right! Haru Okumura, you can do this!"
"Haru and I attempted the goat soup...
We decided not to talk about the taste."
I feel a flash of inspiration...
"Something smells delicious...
Maybe I should sit down and try it."
A whackin' stick.
A blindfold.
A keen sixth sense.
"True, we could track down a large branch
somewhere. We'll also need a blindfold."
"Sorry if this is silly, [1B]S1, but I hope
you'll oblige me."
"True, we'll need something to cover my eyes.
I guess I'll also need a big stick of some sort?"
"Good point—no matter what the tools are,
missing the mark has to be rather embarrassing."
"Now that we've started the actual planning,
I'm beginning to get a bit nervous..."
"Perhaps you should warm up as much as you
feel necessary in the Jail first before taking
your skills to the fruit."
Really!?
"Sorry if this is silly, [1B]S1, but I hope
you'll oblige me."
A whackin' stick.
A blindfold.

a watermelon won't affect your nerves
at all."

"A nice bowl o' soba sounds pretty good to ya
now, doesn't it? How about we grab some
once we wrap up this investigation stuff."
"Hey, uh, where'd Gramps go? Last I saw him,
he was wanderin' around out back..."
"But there's this strange feeling I keep getting as
I ask around... Like they're hiding something."
"If I slide this one over, a winding stairwell
leading to the lab will appear before us!
...Nah, no way. Too cliché."
This is most likely it... Sooo...
"What would you like to do, [1B]S1?
If we're going to investigate, I can summon
everyone here for you."
Please do.
Hold off on that for a bit.
"Okay, I'll contact everyone."
You want to keep looking around? Okay.
"PubSec playin' around in the sand with the
Phantom Thieves... *sigh* What is this country
comin' to?"
"Whatever it may be, I have evidence of it.
I took plenty of photos during our time on
the beach."
"Wha— No, delete 'em! You gotta delete 'em!
Please!?"
"Ya know, I'm startin' to get hungry. Think it's
chow time yet?"
"But I know I'm personally looking forward to
the future, both my own and everyone else's,
too."
"I agree. Let's not forget to meet up every so
often; that way, we can always keep each
other up to date on the changes in our lives."
"What started as just a deal turned into me
full-on joining the Phantom Thieves... Never
thought I'd see the day."
"Not only that, but you guys taught me how to
cook... Can't say I expected a bunch of annoying
little rugrats to be so caring."
"But thanks to that, I got to see Akane smile again.
That Leblanc Curry's the real deal."
"I know all I've done is rely on you guys, so allow
me to clean this up once all's said and done. I'd
appreciate you letting me off the hook by then."
"If, later on down the road, you find you're in a
similar place and don't know what to do... Well,
just lemme know."
I'll be the man I should've been back then.
"Hahah, I figured you'd say that. Can't say I'd ever picture you flashin' a badge."

"Meat would be nice too, jingisukan for instance.
I heard eating lamb is good for your skin."
"Though I don't come across lamb much...
so I wouldn't know how to prepare it."
"Jingisukan... Authentic Hokkaido cuisine...
Okay, search complete."
"I found a recipe you might like.
Have [1B]S1 make it."
"That's how you're commemorating our trip...?
Leave it to Yusuke, I guess."
"Oh, [1B]S1. I'm glad you're here."
"I went to eat some takoyaki before we leave, but... I ended up winning an extra order in a raffle."
"Do you think you could eat it for me? I don't
think I can eat this all by myself."
"I'd give it to my sister if she were here, but that's obviously not an option right now."
"I'm sure one order's plenty for me. In any case,
let me know when we're heading out, okay?"
I went and checked in on how our store here was doing.
"Everyone was working so hard... And not only
that, but the customers looked really happy, too."
"I want all of our restaurants to make everyone
feel welcome, no matter who they are. I'll need
to work just as hard once we get back to Tokyo."
"[1B]S1, you sure know how to geek out.
Any true otaku would hit this place last!"
"Y'know, come to think of it, we didn't have much time to go to Akihabara this summer..."
"Man, so this whole place is one giant comedy
theater. I guess Osaka is kinda Japanese
comedy's home turf, though."
"What started as just a deal turned into me
full-on joining the Phantom Thieves... Never
thought I'd see the day."
"I know all I've done is rely on you guys, so allow
me to clean this up once all's said and done. I'd
appreciate you letting me off the hook by then."
"Oh, right, I almost forgot. Akane kept bugging me about getting you guys a gift."
So here. This is from us.
It's a police baton keychain...
"Kinda weird to give a police baton to the
Phantom Thieves, I guess, but I thought it'd look
good on ya."
"Be kinda cool stickin' it to some overpowered
creep with something so simple. The hero makes
the weapon, not the other way around, right?"
"You know, back in the day, fugitives'd become
detectives all the time. Maybe you should try
becoming an officer yourself."
Not interested...
No way.
If I'm feeling up to it.
"Oh, right, I almost forgot. Akane kept bugging me about getting you guys a gift."

"You know, back in the day, fugitives'd become
detectives all the time. Maybe you should try
becoming an officer yourself."
Not interested...
No way.
If I'm feeling up to it.
"Hahah, I figured you'd say that. Can't say I'd ever picture you flashin' a badge."
"Heh, is that right? Well, when that day comes,
I'll be the one givin' the orders, ya hear?"
"Oh hey, you're here too, [1B]S1?
Actually, I was feeling a bit hungry myself..."
"But since I can't finish an entire portion on my
own, I was thinking I might not get it."
"If it's all right with you, why don't we split
a cheese-and-pork okonomiyaki between us?
That way we both get just the right amount."
I enjoyed okonomiyaki with Makoto...
I feel a flash of inspiration...
"Something smells delicious...
Maybe I should sit down and try it."
"Ah, I see you're interested in crab hot pot.
Then please allow me to join."
"I simply cannot restrain myself after seeing such
an elaborate display from outside."
"All I ask is a simple bite, nothing more."
"So in other words, you're bumming off
[1B]S1... I'm guessing your
wallet's as empty as your stomach?"
I enjoyed crab hot pot with Yusuke...
This is delicious beyond compare!
I feel a flash of inspiration...
"The slightly pungent, yet pleasant aroma of sushi
rice is wafting out... Maybe I should try eating here."
This smell... Is that what I think it is!?
"It's sushi, Osaka-style. Many kinds of ingredients
are layered on top of each other, then pressed
onto sushi rice to form box-shaped bites."
"Ooh, so it's more than just fish over rice.
Hey [1B]S1, can you sneak me some!?"
I enjoyed sushi with Morgana...
"I can't tell whether the rice is sweet or sour...
but it meshes so well with all the ingredients!
My taste buds are in paradise right now!"
I feel a flash of inspiration...

No can do.
Not interested.
"That is not possible. People who don't
live here can't take part in a local election."
Hnnh? Where's that voice coming from?
"Wait a minute, you're a tourist, aren't ya? Well,
no matter. You just bear this in mind:"
"What did you say!? Why, the nerve of ya!
I oughta set you straight..."
"...Oh, you're a tourist. Well, no matter. You just
bear this in mind:"
"Young people these days... Use this
as a learning experience."
"Mayor Hyodo is a wonderful person! She'll be
the one to guide Sapporo—nay, this country—
perhaps even this very world to new heights!"
"This upcoming election is the first step on that journey! Mayor Hyodo, Sapporo stands with you!"
Long live Mayor Hyodo! Glory to Sapporo!
Okay... That was definitely not normal.
Long live Mayor Hyodo! Glory to Sapporo!
"Something about his passion really rubs me
the wrong way..."
This guy's totally out of it...
"I will... Well, I'll try. *sniffle* I caught a cold, you
see."
"I mean, I'd like to, but I don't have the time.
I work the early shift tomorrow too..."
"I need to hurry up and recover... Or at least get
back to work. Otherwise the mayor's gonna be
livid..."
Did he say the mayor...?
"Hey! Gimme all the energy drinks and medicine
you got! I'm talking about emptying the shelves
here!"
"Is he being overworked like that city employee
we saw this afternoon?"
*hack* Shit... I need to get better already.
"...Why would Hyodo work her own employees
so hard?"
"...Please tell us the password. Ann's happiness
depends on it."
Hm? Who said that?
S-Sophia!
"Hey you. You're voting for Mayor Hyodo this
coming election, arent'cha?"
Of course.
"...It sounds like you're planning to give it to
someone important to you, but I will make no
exceptions."
"In all my years, I've never seen a politician as
pure and honest as Mayor Hyodo."
"What would a bunch of whippersnappers like
those Phantom Thieves know of what a marvel
she is?"
"Truly, they're an unforgiveable bunch..."
"Mayor Hyodo's only human. We all make
mistakes from time to time, don't we?"
"Even after all that's happened, I still believe.
I have a feeling she's not out of this race just yet."
"Mayor Hyodo... I can finally meet you at last...
Oh yes... You are all my hopes and dreams
embodied!"
"Is he talking about going to the speech
tomorrow? We'd better not let our guard down."
"A paradise as pure as snow... A paradise as pure
as snow! Yes! That's what I want! Right now!"
"And those who stand in the way... must be
eliminated..."
"*sigh* I've been a strong supporter of Mariko
Hyodo from day one... but I never knew she was
involved in a scandal."
"I feel... betrayed. It's like all my strength has
suddenly run out."
"Oh, are you kids Hyodo supporters too?"
"No? You're only collecting rumors about her?
Is that for an assignment or something?"
"Day in and day out, all I hear is the same old
fanaticism. People won't shut up about Hyodo."
"They say she's as trustworthy as it gets, but I'm
pretty sure she's hiding something."
There's no such thing as an honest politician.
See. I knew she was hiding something.
"I wish people in power got their just desserts
like the rest of us. I don't care if the ones dishing
it out are the Phantom Thieves or not."
"I certainly didn't expect that press conference
to go the way it did. Was I being too harsh on
the mayor...?"
*sigh* ...Maybe I should just run for election.
"Welcome. Purchase your meal ticket and go
take a seat at the counter."
"Huh? What do I think of the mayor? ...Couldn't
tell ya. Politics ain't really my thing."

"Alice... You're so freakin' adorable...
No one could ever compare to you..."
"I'll... I'll do anything for you! Buy you fancy
jewelry, take you out to the finest restaurants...
I'd sign my life over to you if I could!"
"This guy's completely lost it! It's like he can't
even see us!"
"I've heard of being crazy for someone, but this
is way too far."
"Alice... Make me your love slave... Step on me
with your pointy heel of heartlessness!"
"Alice did nothing wrong! It's the Phantom
Thieves who are in the wrong here!"
Is Alice maybe... not that cute?
"*sigh* Hope my girlfriend will take me back.
Maybe if I let her step on me a bit..."
"Come on, man, I need the money! Please!"
"Again!? I just lent you money for all your
Alice-obsessed bullshit!"
"I know, but there's a new Alice original coming
out and I reeeeeally really need it! Like, I won't
even be able to think or breathe if I don't get it!"
"That guy with the brown hair, it's the same guy
we saw before, right?"
"Dude... Why're you suddenly obsessed over
some random-ass idol in the first place?"
"Are you serious, though? You actually went to a
loan shark? I can't believe you..."
"So he's borrowing from shady lenders, only to
get shady merchandise in return."
"That ain't normal. And didn't the other guy say
he suddenly got obsessed?"
Could it be... the influence of the Metaverse?
"Don't be so stingy... Do I seriously have to beg
right now?"
"Yeah, beg me not to slap you in the face for
being such a goddamn simp!"
"The Phantom Thieves sent Alice a calling card?
Why? Why would they do that when she's the
embodiment of perfection?"
Shiiiiit... Did I really spend that much on Alice?
You finally realized?
"Man, you've always been like this. Once you find
a girl you like, you abandon everything else."
Well... Fine. I'll lend you what you need.
"Alice? Of course I've heard of her; everyone in
class has. Especially the boys—they love her."
"My friend's boyfriend even went as far as
breaking off their relationship, all because
he took a sudden interest in Alice."
"I know she's cute and all, but cute enough to
leave somebody behind?"
0
"I don't really get Alice's sense of fashion.
It's too loud, for one thing."
"Hey, is it true the Phantom Thieves are back!?"
"Nothing happened for half a year, so I thought
they were gone..."
"I knew Alice was doing something sketchy to
get that popular."
"Seems like all the boys in the class are back to
normal. Thank goodness."
Ugh... So hot out...
"You ever wonder why we have to wear
jackets in this weather?"
"Our company's so old-fashioned, forcing us
businessmen to wear suits..."
"Huh? Yeah, what about the Phantom Thieves?
The heat bake your brain or something?"
"Maybe EMMA knows where I can get something
more breathable... With sweat-wicking fabric...
Ooh, now we're talkin'."
Alice? Is this an interview or something?
"Sorry, but I hate her guts. Go ask someone else."
"Alice is the type who toys with peoples' lives.
She only cares about fans lining her pockets."
"Is it true that the Phantom Thieves are back?
That's so awesome!"
"You hear that, Alice? It's the end for you, wicked
witch! Hah! Go get her, Phantom Thieves!"
"Wow, you came from Sapporo? That's crazy.
I'm surprised you made it all this way."
"There's honestly nothing here, but I hope you
enjoy your stay."
Did you all have fun at the beach?
"Hahaha. That's the way it should be when you're
young. Having fun, with not a care in the world..."
"How strange. I feel like I was chasing after
someone yesterday..."
"Oh yes. I was chasing the heathen scum that
threatened to defile our hallowed ground."
...But what the heck does that mean?
"Research lab? Oh, that place up over yonder...
Yeah, I have no idea."
"I actually quit my job and just moved here not
too long ago, so I still have much to learn about
the island."
"Oh, you want to hear a little tune?"
～♪ ～♪♪
"God, I love the sanshin."
"Going already? Didn't you get here only
yesterday?"
"How about a farewell song... What? No?
You sure?"
"You're looking for a research lab? Sorry, but I'm
just a tourist."
"Why not ask EMMA? You have a phone, right?"
"I came to this island in search of myself but I
can't figure out what I want to do in life."
"Ugh, this is so depressing... If only EMMA could
decide everything for me."
"EMMA, tell me what to do with my life."
...Guess it's not that easy. *sigh*
You guys tourists?
"There are places on this island where swimming
is restricted, so I advise you to be careful."
You're leaving already?
"How was Kukojima? Hope you were able to
make some treasured memories here."
"Whew... Nothing like an ice-cold glass of
shikuwasa juice after a day of fun in the sun."
"It was really loud outside last night. I wonder
what was going on..."
"Look at this! Bookwyrm deleted her social
media account..."
"Isn't Bookwyrm that author you really like?
She's been putting out quite a lot of work
lately."
"Maybe she got depressed. Her last post did
mention how she's tired of ""trying to make her
voice heard in a vacuum."""
Do you think... Ango Natsume is the cause?
"Have you read Ango's book? The story and the
dialogue, it's so similar to what Bookwyrm
would do..."
"Hey, be careful! We're talking about Sogo
Natsume's grandson here. You'll get flamed
if you talk about him carelessly."
Hey... Did you hear that?
"She seemed suspicious of Ango Natsume
stealing other people's work."
I wonder if it's true or just some rumor.
"I was so looking forward to Bookwyrm's
new work..."
"She was a victim of the establishment!
Bookwyrm must be avenged!"
"...Please, Phantom Thieves! You must change
Ango's heart!"
Guess what! Bookwyrm's account is back!
"The culprit totally admitted to it... Well, it seems
like Bookwyrm will be back up and running in
no time."
"Yeah! Phantom Thieves, you're the greatest!"
"Why... Why do this to me, my honey pie?"
"We swore our love to each other here. You told
me how special I was to you... So why?"
What did I do wrong...
"I care little for Natsume, and even less about the
Phantom Thieves. My heart years for my one and
only love..."
"...Wait! Can the Phantom Thieves change my
honey pie's heart?"
"Oh, I'm terrible... Even the thought of asking
some rogues to change the heart of my love
makes me the lowest of the low!"
"Were such a thing to happen, it would be of no
consequence. False love is no better than false
hope. I would only be condemned to suffer."
...Very well then.
"I'm going to ask her out again. I'll get a proper
job, put some money aside for our future..."
"Mere affection is not enough to protect what's
important to you! Wait for me, honey piiie!"
Can I help you...?
"Password!? We didn't hear anything about a
password..."
......
"Oh Ango... My sweet, sweet Ango... Your
divinely inspired literature is out of stock
everywhere..."
"Those rotten Phantom Thieves... What good
does it do to steal my precious wordsmith
away?"
Ango is all I have...
"Ango is the worst. Does he realize how much
I invested in him? And for what..."
"It doesn't seem like you know it. Sorry, but I'm
going to have to ask you to leave."
"Well, we've got the right place. Now we just need that password..."
"Finally, somewhere I can relax. All I ever hear
at the station is Natsume, Natsume,
Natsume..."
"Great. The moment I leave the station, the
Phantom Thieves leave their calling card!
If only I had stayed to see it!"
"Everyone's bashing Natsume now... but to tell
you the truth, I was a little impressed."
"Whether it was triggered by the Phantom
Thieves or not, apologizing like that takes
guts."
"Maybe I'll skim through his book next time I see
one on the shelves... Or at least take a glance at
the title."
"Why does he get all the attention? My novel's
way better."
"Ugh. I wish the Phantom Thieves would steal
everybody's hearts..."
"The Phantom Thieves are in Sendai!? Oh man!
They gotta change everyone's hearts! They just
gotta!"
"So... it was all plagiarism, eh? Hahahaha! This is
great! Hey Ango Natsume, instead of being an
author, you shoulda been a ""copy-writer!"" Hah!"
"Hehehe... Now I'M gonna be the one to lead the
light novel world, with no one to stand in my
way!"
"Publishers, here I come!"
"Are you here to pray? Or would you like your
fortune?"
"I've heard there were calling cards found at the
station... from the Phantom Thieves. I hope it's
not a sign of a deeper disturbance..."
"Recently, our visitor count has returned to
normal. There also seems to be less concern
among the people."
"Perhaps this is all according to the will of
Lord Date Masamune..."
"I need to buy every last one... Then maybe Ango
will finally notice me!"
"If I don't hurry, I'll miss his book signing..."
Natsume's doing a book signing?
"...Search complete. Natsume will be holding a
book signing nearby, and it's happening very
soon."
Wait... Is that why they're all here!?
"The bookstore's in a mall named Porto, and
the event starts in one hour."
"I see... All right, [1B]S1.
Let's come back here when we're done
collecting rumors."
"*cough* It's no use... *cough-cough*
Must hurry... *wheeze* Need medicine..."
Hang in there.
Go see a doctor.
"*cough* *cough* ...I need to finish cleaning, and
fast!"
"What!? We have a three-day weekend!?
I can rest for that long!?"
"Oh no... Thinking about all the sleep I'm about
to get is making me... *yawn* ...Tired."
"You need something? Look, I'm meeting up with
a chick right now, so maybe later."
"Heard the Phantom Thieves showed up in
Sapporo, too. That's all my clients talk about
now... It's kinda awkward."
"Man, I really underestimated how popular
those Phantom Thieves could be."
"We did a Phantom Thieves event at the club and
the line was out the door, man."
"Popped so many damn champagne bottles,
I nearly lost count, haha. If I ever meet a
phantom thief, I'd like to shake their hand."
"Hey there, handsome! Wanna buy me a drink?"
"Aww you're still a high schooler? Too bad, then."
"Ugh. I wonder if the Phantom Thieves can steal
the heart of that asshole customer."
"We told him we don't allow touching, but he
keeps groping away..."
"Listen, you won't believe this! That perv actually
apologized to me yesterday!"
"Seems like he was working for the mayor.
He said the press conference motivated him to
clean up his act, or something."
"Apparently his work had caused him all this
pent-up stress... Not like that's any excuse to be
an absolute pig."
"Buuuut, he did drop a lot of money on us last
night... He'd better have learned his lesson."
"Just the other day, a man came begging to get
one for his ""honey pie""..."
"I've learned a ton during my internship at Madicce! Just waiting on that job offer, and then I'm set for life!"
"Huh? You scored an internship with Madicce!?
I heard the competition to get in's pretty stiff."
"Hmph. When you know your stuff as well as I do, the test and interview are a walk in the park!"
"I'm stepping my game up even further in the fall! Better watch out, or you'll get left behind!"
"How's the internship at Madicce? You think
they'll let you go with all this Phantom Thieves
stuff going on right now?"
"Heh. I've got nothing to worry about. Way I see
it, a crisis is just another opportunity."
"I bet Mr. Konoe brings the Phantom Thieves
down and moves on to bigger and better things
before we know it!"
Y-Yeah... I'm sure Mr. Konoe will be fine...
"Looks like Madicce doesn't really have time for
interns anymore... Maybe they're going out of
business..."
Wha--?
"I'm sure it comes as kind of a shock, but if you
want my opinion, I say pack up and move on.
You know what they say, be reflective. "
"""Flexible""... The word is ""flexible."""
"Hey, did you hear!? This store's having a 
""Support Konoe 1 yen sale"" next week!"
"Konoe-san's the big one to look out for this day
and age! Fortune follows him wherever he goes!"
"Ohhh, I can't wait!"
"I don't know much about these Phantom Thieves,
but once this sale's over, I want nothing to do
with them!"
"You hear the news? There's a 1 yen sale next
week!"
"Apparently, they're changing the name of the
sale to the ""Phantom Thieves Special,"" but, hey,
at prices that low, who's complaining!?"
Aw man... Now what am I gonna do...?
"I was going to have EMMA tell me which skewer
shop I should go to..."
"EMMA always finds the best places to eat when
I'm out on these business trips."
I'd be totally screwed if it was all up to me.
I didn't have to think about anything... And those damn Phantom Thieves had to go and ruin it.
"So the Phantom Thieves are starting a war with
Konoe, is that it? There's no way he'll lose to
them, right?"
What's gonna happen?
This is all the Phantom Thieves' fault...
I don't want a life without EMMA.

"Oh, you want to know about Ango Natsume?
Hmph, you and the rest of society. Everyone's
talking about him lately, and it makes me sick."
"Pretentious pricks like that are always hiding
something."
"I heard business has been good lately, thanks to
all that Natsume gift merch."
"People need to wake up. There are plenty of
other good authors out there."
Can I help you...?
"...The Zunda Supreme Parfait? Oh, I see. You've
heard the rumors, is that it?"
"Very well, then. If you'd please provide the
password."
Huh? A research lab...?
"...How about you visit the beach instead? Yeah,
why don't you go do that?"

"Oh, you're from Tokyo, huh? No wonder you're
so spiffy-lookin'! "
"The Phantom Thieves are causing a real ruckus
down here, but be sure to enjoy yourself
anyhow!"
What's with all the commotion? You be safe now.
"Oh, hey there! Aw, you're goin' home? So? How
was the trip? Fun?"
Hahahaha! Save your breath! Your face says it all!
"Well, be sure to stop by next time you visit!"
Damn it... Where're those Phantom Thieves...
"Just you wait... I'll wring their necks! Every one
of 'em!"
"Quit fuckin' around! Konoe-san's sent a lotta
money our way!"
We can't back off now... Gotta see it through!
No! It can't be! Konoe-san...
E-EMMA... What do I do now?
"EMMA, can you hear me? EMMA...?"
"Nevertheless, I refused him. No doubt he's out
searching high and low for the password as we
speak."
Welcome!
"Alice Hiiragi? Oooh, do you mean the Alice
clothing line? Why yes, we DO carry it! "
"But I'm sooo sorry, we're all sold out! "
"We only put them out 10 minutes ago, but the
fans came in and swiped them all up!"
I'm sooo sorry that you missed it!
"Wow, gone in 10 minutes?"
"I guess it's possible, but those fans have some
dedication to buy it out so fast..."
Let's be sure to remember this.
"Alice's clothing line sold out in 10 minutes,
huh..."
"There are so many clothes here, but all the
ones designed by Alice are sold out."
"Alice's clothing line was interesting. Do you
think we'll be able to see it again someday?"
"So he's looking for it too... Looks like we're back
to square one."
"...You're going to shut us down unless we clean
up?"
"Heeey, what kind of joke is that? We clean
the club thoroughly every day."
"Huh? You found a millimeter of dust on the
handrail?"
"Come on, quit fooling around..."
"...Wait, you're serious?"

Y-You're right. I can't get discouraged here.

"L-Lady Ann isn't my honey pie! I just want to
make her happy or smile or... you know."

"How about we head to the station for now?
Someone there might know something."
"Yeah, we've done all we can here. Let's try asking around at the station."
"I'm sorry to keep dragging you along with this,

Ann smile!"

A parfait password? I've never heard of that.
"So she doesn't know... I guess we'll have to start
asking around at the station, then."
A parfait password? I've never heard of that.

"Password...? I'm sorry, I don't know anything
about that."
"Another dead end... Let's try asking around at the
station."
"Oh, you know, I think the person who bought the
parfait was talking to the lady outside the shop..."
"Does she mean the manager? I wonder what they
were talking about..."
"It's times like these that I want to put a smile on
everyone's faces in whatever way I can."
"Eheheh, at the very least, I know I'll be happy!
Thanks a bunch, [1B]S1!"
"I have confirmed that a request has been posted.
Let's do what we can to help."
"Aha... Ahaha! 'Kay, thanks!"
"Haha, I knew you'd get it, dude! Let's chow down
on some top-tier ramen and get our power levels
back up!"
"Hey, can you blame me!? This ramen is KING!
We're talkin' ALL TIME!"
"Yo, look at all the ramen spots they got! It's
crazy how they're, like, everywhere."
"Man, this place is the real deal. I almost don't
wanna leave!"
"Good grief... Feasting your eyes is fine, but
don't forget why we're here."
"I didn't forget! We were, uh, lookin' for rumors
about Hyodo, right?"
My gut's tellin' me we'll find some here. Maybe.
"Ahh, I just can't resist the smell!"
Look at all the people...
"I thought maybe a celebrity was here, but I
guess they all came to check out that poster?"
......
"What happened, Yusuke!?"
...Look at this.
"It's canned juice, featuring
milk and fish on the label..."
"Returning search results: This drink, called
""Primordial Soup,"" is considered a regional
specialty."
"They press the juices out of locally sourced
fish and blend it with fresh Hokkaido milk.
It's marketed toward men in particular."
"I dunno about all that... I'm just worried about
the smell."
"Who would invent such a monstrosity...?
It seems Sapporo's culture is not to be trifled
with!"
"Sheesh, you got my hair all standing up for
nothing. Anyway, are you done gathering
rumors?"
"Not in the slightest. I was so taken aback that I
lost focus."
"Perhaps I can recover if I offer this to you, [1B]S1. Please inform me of how it tastes."
"A prebiotic soup that enhances the potency of
one's manhood... Whether such marketing has
merit, we shall perhaps see."
"Though the city may look attractive on the
surface, beneath that veneer lies a palpable
emptiness..."

"Man, so this whole place is one giant comedy
theater. I guess Osaka is kinda Japanese
comedy's home turf, though."
"I was looking for rumors online, but I found out
something even more intriguing."
"Get this, Makoto. There's a very creepy building
in Suzushino... and it's supposed to be haunted."
Haunted...? By what? Where!?
"Uh, there are only a few beings I can think of
that can actually haunt a building. As for where
it is—"
It's okay! You don't need to say it!
"Relax, it's just an urban legend. 'Tis the season,
after all."
"True... Nothing like a summertime ghost story
to keep you awake all night."
"I've noticed there're a lot of posters about a
cleanup campaign taking place."
"It seems they're making an effort to beautify the
city, or at least that's how it's framed."
"Could this be the mayor's doing? Something
seems a little off to me..."
"I'm not too familiar of those traditional
comedy shows, but there's usually a ""funny man""
and a ""straight man,"" isn't that right?"
"It might be due to the upcoming election,
but nearly everyone is talking about Mari-san."
"I haven't heard any criticism, either...
They're all singing her praises. To me,
it's almost unnatural..."
I wonder...
"What other kind of ""men"" are there?"
0
"If this is how hearts are being changed, there
must be a ton of victims already."
We can't just let her go on like this... We have to stop her!
"The keyword is ""Snow City""... Sounds pretty,
doesn't it?"
"Have any of you noticed there's no litter on the
streets?"
What a sweet fragrance...
"Apparently the corn wagon is only open
seasonally."
"That's what got me interested—the scarcity of it.
Plus, corn is most delicious around this time of
year."
"Excuse me, can I get two orders of grilled corn?"
"All right, two it is. Coming right up."
"One's for you. You know, since you're always
doing so much for us."
Let's keep at it and get through this Jail together.
"Oh Lady Ann... You slay me with your
thoughtfulness!"
"Man, just hearin' you hurts my ears..."
"Wouldn't it be nice to celebrate with some
authentic Hokkaido cuisine?"
"Ah, travel is wonderful. Seeing new things
stimulates the senses like none other."
"No matter what, I'm going to do my best..."
"No need to push yourself, Haru. Remember, you
always have us."
I'll do anything I can to help.
"Thank you... But I'm all right. I've already made
up my mind to see this through."
"I need to see for myself what changed Mari-san
into... who she is now."
"Thank you. And I'm sorry. I need to keep it
together."

"You're kidding, right...? Wait, is this a bit?"

This drugstore sticks out like a sore thumb...
"Oh yeah, I saw a secret medicine in there
that apparently makes you ""feel stronger,
last longer."""
"Maybe it could help you ""feel stronger"" and
""last longer"" in Jail?"
"People typically enjoy following those who
actually give a damn... Lot of folks back at HQ
could stand to learn that."
"""Beautiful destination"" my ass. Kinda ruins the
beauty seein' a sick employee get abused."
"Well, at least the food's beautiful. Take this
seafood bowl for instance—it's pretty much
a work of art."
The sashimi's good too.
That was abrupt.
It's incredible.
"It's unreal how good the food is here. I'm gonna
regret it if I don't try it all..."
"Yeah... maybe. Guess I got hungry from getting
all worked up."
Right? How can I not eat this?
Really? At a time like this?
"But... it does look tasty. And at this price, it's a
steal."
"Mewhehe... Well, the lady has spoken. Let's all—"
"Unfortunately, it seems that pets are not
allowed."
Not again!
"Don't worry, they do takeout too, so we can all
eat together!"
"That Shadow stampede, or ""March of the Frosts""
as I've come to call it, was nothing short of a
marvel."
"Simply replaying it in my mind's eye fills me
with the deepest passion... and makes me want
to shout from the rooftops:"
Hee-ho!!!
"Grocery shopping in Hokkaido is a pretty
unique experience. I feel like we have access
to food that's only available here."
"Mari-san is making her staff clean up this
flowerbed up too..."
......
"Are you okay, Haru?"
"I don't know what to say, but somehow I'll find a
way to be useful."
Sophia...
"Thank you. And I'm sorry. I need to keep it
together."
"This Jail's freezing! Whatever happened to
summer?"
"Almost makes me wanna curl up in a kotatsu...
Hey, maybe I should put one in the Necronomicon!"
"This kotatsu you speak of. I heard it's difficult to
emerge from it once you get comfortable."
"Oh, the weather outside is freezing♪ But my
kotatsu is oh so pleasing♪ And since I have a
Necronomicon♪ Snow or Shadow, bring it on!"
"Wouldn't it be nice to celebrate with some
authentic Hokkaido cuisine?"

"Gramps is gonna be drivin' all night, yeah? We
should prolly get him somethin' to help him stay
awake."
"Hmm... How about this one? ""Eight heads of
sleep-slaying terror! Unstoppable Orochi 50ml."""
...Shit sounds kinda dangerous.
"Anyhow, I don't really wanna go in here. Wonder
if we can just order it online or somethin'..."
An hour!? That's worse than I thought it was gonna be...
Maybe we could just spend some time exploring the Jail instead?
"We've had ramen every place we've been so far... Sendai, Sapporo, Okinawa, Hakata... No way we can miss it here."
"At this point, we've basically eaten all the ramen
Japan's got to offer! Hell of a trip, but, man, was
it worth it."
0
"We should prolly snag some ramen while we're
here, huh?"
"Hehe, sorry, [1B]S1. Makoto and I
tried this place earlier."
"And the food tasted just as amazing as it looked.
We really had a great time."
"It had the calories to match, too... We should
probably get our butts in gear and work it all off!"
"That parfait probably had around 500 calories
or so... Nothing an hour of running won't fix."
"I suppose we should say our goodbyes to
Sapporo. It's too bad we couldn't stay a little bit
longer."
"Hmm... Sad. Nothing came out. I was really
hoping we'd see one."
Came out? What do you mean?
"Futaba told me that ghosts have been known to
appear in Suzushino."
"Uh, c-can we maybe save this conversation for
later?"
"F-Futaba gets pretty excited about urban legends
and stuff. They're just rumors, though..."
...Right?
All..? Haven't we only been to 5 cities?
Sapporo's given me some wonderful memories...
"Which reminds me... I bought this at the general
store, and I was hoping you'd hold on to it for
me. "
"If I ever fall down and start crying again, I want
you to show me this."
"It will remind me of all that happened here, and
that people can always get back up, no matter
what. "
"Thank you so much for everything. I truly hope
we come back here someday."
"Aw, who's countin'!? Either way, we've had a shit
ton of ramen!"
"Wait... We forgot to eat ramen in Kyoto, didn't we?"
"One of these days, we'll have to go and do a
ramen tour for real."
Are we heading out soon?
"Since we don't know when we'll be back,
I figured I should get something for myself."
"Should I get the chocolate cake okonomiyaki or
the Madeleine Takoyaki?"
"I already bought some for Shiho, too. I'm so
excited to tell her all about our trip!"
"I've seen a wide variety of signs on this trip, but I must say this one stands out the most."
"A simple statement about cutting excess fat and
staying healthy... It does indeed make one want
to ""hustle their muscle."" "
"Yo! Check this out, [1B]S1! The
detailing on this thing is unreal!"
It's a wooden bear statue...
"Those eyes, that face... And see how it looks like
it's actually moving? Inari'd prolly have a lot to
say about that."
"I saw it and just had to have it. Apparently, they
carve these from the trees around here. Makes
sense, seein' how it's solid wood..."
"I'm more into collecting PVC figures and stuff,
so I've never had too much interest in this kind
of thing."
"Still, I know cool when I see it! Do me a favor and put this in the hideout, okay!?"
"Think I might've found myself a new favorite!
And it's all thanks to this trip."
"I shall sketch this image as a way of closing out our trip. I'll call it, ""Muscle and..."""
"...You guys helped me find something I'd lost a
long time ago."
"Oh, hey, [1B]S1. Sorry for callin' you
outta the blue like that. So, listen, I was
wonderin' if you'd heard of this..."
"Whenever someone says ""Sapporo"" they
automatically think of Sapporo ramen, to which
I'm like, ""yeah, dude, what else?"""
"But, apparently, there's this ""legendary ramen""
somewhere around here that's the king of all
ramen!"
"So when I heard that, I was all like... Like..."
"OH, SHIIIIIIT! WE GOTTA EAT IT!"
"You're feelin' me on this, right!? C'mon,
[1B]S1, I need that ramen and I need it
now!"
We have to go.
You're getting too excited.
Now's not the time.
"Sure, but, come on, I'll bet it tastes amazing!
We'll be sorry if we don't snag some while we
have the chance!"
"A ramen so delicious they call it ""king""... I would
also like to see it, [1B]S1."
"See? You heard the lady. Now you don't got a
choice."
"It's at a place called ""Migoku,"" and I think it's
pretty close by. We'll probably have to get in
line! Hah!"
"""Migoku""... Hold on."
"...I ran a search, but it looks like their legendary
ramen is already sold out."
"Wha...? No, that can't be... How!?"
"It's so popular that all of the meal tickets for it
typically sell out moments after the shop opens.
Today's portion is already gone too."
"Yo, when it opens...? Guess we're shit outta luck,
then."
"...No, we may still have a chance. There seems to
be an alternate way to get meal tickets."
Another way!? For real!?
"The shop manager has expressed that he wants
tourists to be able to enjoy the ramen as well."
"So he intentionally sets aside some tickets to be
sold in a different location."
"Whoa! Props to the manager! So, where they
sellin' these other tickets?"
"Apparently it's a shop in Suzushino with ""a red
sign""... Sorry, I don't have any more details."
A red sign? I feel like those're everywhere...
"Well, hey, that's more than enough to go off of.
Let's get to it and find those tickets."
"...You're on board with this too, yeah?"
0
I suppose.
For the ramen.
I'll reveal its location.
"Thanks man! You mind if I just send this over to
you as a request?"
*sigh* Welcome...
"He seems troubled. I wonder what could be
""his deal."""
"Whatever it may be, let's ask him about the
King Ramen meal tickets."
So you're here for the ramen too? Of course...
"Yes, I am the one who keeps a few tickets
onhand for tourists who don't know how
it works around here..."
"But I can't sell you any. Now, I'll have to ask
you to leave."
"The physical toll it's taken on his body is just
not worth the reward. At the pace he works,
his elbow's liable to give out anytime now."
"Of course, you might say, ""Why not take breaks,
get more staff?"" He's such a perfectionist, he has
to do everything himself or it won't happen."
"He refuses to listen to medical advice or reason,
so I, ah... lighten his burden for him."
"The best I can do is hang onto these as long as
possible. The fewer tickets in circulation, the
longer he can stay healthy."
"Would you sell the tickets if the chef's elbow
were okay?"
What was that? Is someone... talking on a phone?
"Well... Yeah, I'd be happy to, but it's not like
there's any sort of magic potion that could fix
an elbow without any recovery time necessary."
"Excellent. This amount should suffice. Thank
you for your assistance, [1B]S1."
"If we give these to the pharmacy manager, he
should be able to stitch together an effective
compression sleeve with the outer layers."
"""I can almost smell the ramen already,"" I would
say if this device had any olfactory input. Let's
return to the Suzushino pharmacy."
"I am Sophia, humanity's companion."
"You're back? I told you the tickets aren't for
sale..."
"[1B]S1, lay it on him."
What the...
"Wow, these are surprisingly strong for how
flexible they are! And they don't feel like
they'd be too tough to cut and stitch..."
"I think this could actually make for a solid
compression sleeve! I'm going to get started
on it right now!"
"You know who you are? You're the savior of
the best ramen in all of Sapporo! What's your
name?"
"Dude holy shit YOU DID IT! I can't believe it!
You're amazing, [1B]S1!"
"I'd sing a little ditty for a bowl of my own; and
if you found it helpful, I'd yodel through the
phone."
Huh? ...What?
"I want to see the King Ramen too, so I helped."
"Oh, okay... Not sure whatcha mean by that,
but I'm not sure I wanna ask!"
"Anyways, thanks, Sophia and [1B]S1!"
No prob.
"All right, let's get to that restaurant! Legendary
ramen, here we come!"
Woo!
"I'm countin' on you dude! We get to eat this
stuff, and I'll make sure to work my ass off like
you never seen!"
"That ramen sounds particularly interesting.
I'd like to see it too."
"After you accept the request, let's begin the
hunt for ""the store with the red sign."""
0
"Probably the only thing that would work is a
compression sleeve—that way, he could work
right off the bat without risk of blowing it out."
Huh? Is that a girl on the phone again?
0
Why can't you?
Pleeease?
"""Sold out""?"
"I doubt you'd understand if I explained, but if
I were to sell you these tickets, I'd be injuring
the chef, indirectly."

"There's a message
from Yusuke..."
0
"...You know, you kids sure do cook for
yourselves an awful lot, considering how
many restaurants we see all over the place."
"With all these places to check out, why're you
always cookin'?"
"We love cooking and eating together! It's one
of the best parts of this trip."
"Don't you ever cook, Zenkichi?"
"Not really. I'm on the job so often, I usually just
grab something quick, like soba or some bread."
Really? That can't be great for your health...
"Yeah, I know, I know... Aoi used to do all the
cooking."
"Sometimes I'll slap together a meal when I'm
actually home. I mean, Akane's there, and all."
"She doesn't seem to be the biggest fan of my
cooking, though..."
"I feel like I'm gonna regret asking this, but,
what do you make?"
"I fill a pot with water, add salt, chopped
vegetables, and whatever meat's on sale."
"Sometimes I'll add some sugar to balance out
the salt if I added too much. That's all it takes
for an easy, well-balanced dinner."
Good grief... Why would you be proud of that?
"Man, do I feel worse than ever for Akane now."
"Hrgh... What else can I do, though? I've never
learned how to cook a proper meal from
scratch."
"She is a growing girl, though—I wish I could
make her something actually good."
"At least your heart's in the right place. That's
a good sign for you and Akane's relationship."
"Hey, [1B]S1, let's teach Zenkichi a recipe."
"Not just for Zenkichi, but for Akane's sake, too."
That's a great idea.
Time for a master's course.
It's chef time!
"You heard the man! You'd better keep up,
Zenkichi!"
"What!? Did you seriously sign me up for this
without my say-so?"
"Let's see, [1B]S1's a curry master..."
"But we already showed Akane how to make
that. What else could we teach...?"
I know! How about asking Haru and Futaba?
"Haru's gotta know some healthy dishes,
and we all know Futaba is picky about
what she'll eat!"
"All right, Zenkichi, you'd better ask now, before
it's too late!"
"I dunno, now's not really the best time for—"
"Let's go consult Haru first. I'm sure she'll have
an idea of an easy beginner meal for Zenkichi."
"Yes, please, continue poking your nose into my
business."
"Well then, shall we begin the lesson?"
"Zenkichi-san. I said, shall we begin the lesson."
Uhhh... Yes?
"I am the judge presiding over this taste test.
You shall address me as Your Honor!"
"Fine, Sakur— *sigh* I mean... Your Honor."
"Hey, these two are gettin' pretty into it...
You still sure this is a good idea? "
"Of course! They're two of the Phantom Thieves'
best consultants for proper meal preparation.
Just ignore how they're, uhhh, so good at it!"
"Yeah, I guess it's fine, but it's just... All right,
all right. I'll go with the flow—for now."
"Zenkichi-san! Have you washed your hands
thoroughly!? Are your nails trimmed!?"
"And why isn't your apron on!? Your lesson—
No, your battle has already begun!"
"And tie back that studly, long hair of yours!
Show some respect in my courtroom!"
"Oh, boy... I have a feeling I'm about to get it
even worse than I do from the commish."
"Then again, I could probably use some tough
learnin' every so often—especially if it's for
Akane."
"Huh!? You want me to teach Zenkichi-san
how to cook?"
"I mean, I'd be happy to, but I'm still working on
improving my own skills as they are..."
"Well, you've got a sharp eye for ingredients and
way more knowledge about food than he does!
So, there's two points for you already."
"Ooh, sounds like a perfect fit! And plenty
healthy for Akane, too!"
"All right, what say we go buy everything you'll
need while you get ready for the lesson?"
"Zenkichi's gotta learn how to cook with love so
he can really get through to Akane, and I know
you can do that, so it sounds like you're perfect!"
"Aw, that's so sweet! Thank you, Mona-chan."
"Well, if I can be of help, I'd be honored to lend
a hand."
Thank you so much.
You'll do great.
Can I enroll in the class too?
"Oh, no need to thank me. I feel like we owe
something to Zenkichi-san for what he's done
for us—and it'll be a learning experience for me."
I'll give it everything I've got!
"*giggle* I'm not sure there's anything I know
about cooking that you don't already know,
but maybe you'll pick up some new tricks!"
"So, what do you think would make a good first
lesson for Zenkichi?"
Hmm... How about Obanzai-style cuisine?
"Don't you worry, Haru—I'll be right there with
ya too!"
"I'm gonna do a great job at backup—and so are
you, since she asked you and all!"
"Thank you for picking up the ingredients.
I think we're ready for class!"
"Oh! You know what, why don't you try
preparing some obanzai dishes alongside
Zenkichi-san?"
"That way, you can make them whenever you'd
like in the future."
"Also, you'll be able to jump in, in case I get
anything wrong..."
So... What do you say?
I've got your back.
Sounds like a lot of work...
I'll leave it to Morgana.
"Thank you! I feel better already knowing you'll
be there too."
"Huhhh!? You want ME to get in on your cooking
class for Zenkichi!?"
"I mean, it DOES sound like it could be fun, but..."
"I'm not exactly what ya'd call a super-taster.
I'm picky about instant yakisoba brands—that's
about the extent of my culinary knowledge."
"That's just it, though: since you're picky about
flavor, you'd be the best representative of how
Akane might react to Zenkichi's cooking!"
"Oh-ho, I see what you're getting at! So, you're
puttin' Judge Futaba on the case, huh?"
"I don't mean to brag, but I have been evaluating
Leblanc cooking every day for a long time! I vow
to be firm, but impartial during this trial."
"See, you ARE perfect for this! Don't stay your
gavel during this, either—no need to hold back!"
You got it!
"So, what's first on the docket? A classic curry
recipe?"
"No, Haru's going to teach us how to make
Obanzai-style food. "
"Ooh, I've heard of that before! Classic Kyoto
cookin'!"
"Buuuut, it's kinda plain for a middle schooler.
You've gotta teach him to make stuff kids like
to eat."
"And you know what the kids like to eat? Curry
and ramen! Accept no substitutes!"
"Oh... Well, I guess you should probably show
Zenkichi how to make those some other time,
[1B]S1."
He'll be in good hands.
Fiiiine...
"In that case, you must prove your worth as
an instructor!"
"Yesssss! Curry AND ramen! I'm livin' the high
life now!"
"What child could resist such a perfect meal!?
All shall fall in its wake!"
"We get that you're psyched, buuuut how does
it taste? That's what matters here."
"Yes, yes! The taste test!"
......! Oh... my...
IT'S INCREDIBLLLLLLE!
This curry... is just as epic as Sojiro's!
"And the Sapporo-style miso ramen... It's like
I'm getting a vision of the vast Hokkaido skies!"
"These both get an A+! A++, even! My palate is
ready and rarin' to judge!"
"Nyahaha, looks like your cooking's still on
point. We're ready for Haru to start the lesson!"
"Welp, summon me from my chambers when
it's time to start."
"The Leblanc-trained Oracle is ready to analyze
every last bite!"
0
Well? Any luck so far?
"*sigh* Nothin' just yet, but I'll let ya know—"
Hup! Strike that! Here we go...
A buncha people who went off the deep end for Alice got together and posted a public apology online!
"""We are truly sorry for causing so much trouble
over a celebrity. Our actions were wrong, and
we apologize to both the people and to Alice..."""
"Okay... Not only that, the so-called ""anti-Alice""
people are saying they're not getting harassed
anymore! They've even accepted the apology!"
Wow! Then that means...
"The Desires went back to their owners?
We really were able to undo their changes
of heart?"
"Based on what Futaba told us, I don't have any
doubt."
"However, there is a chance the situation isn't
wholly resolved. Remember, we have no idea
if there are more cases like this."
"So, there are Shadows that go after the Desires
we release back to their owners..."
"I don't think we can call this case closed until
we take out those Shadows, too."
"Yeah, but how the hell are we gonna find 'em?"
"We can find them if Morgana sniffs out the
Desires they hold."
"Yeah, I suppose I can do that..."
Excellent! Leave it to the Phantom Nose!
Hey! That is NOT my title!
"ANYway, it looks like we've got a whole other
fight lined up for us now."
"We should have Futaba and Sophia search for
any other cases like this too."
Great idea.
We're counting on you two.
Natsume comes first.
Radical dude! I'll letcha know ASAP!
"Okay. The Phantom Thieves Intel Tag Team is
ready and raring to go."
Radical dude! I'll letcha know ASAP!
"Okay. The Phantom Thieves Intel Tag Team is
ready and raring to go."
"Of course! We don't give up on missions so
easily!"
"If any of you come across another situation
like this one, send it my way!"
"I'll compile the relevant info and list it up for
you—kinda like how we used the requests on
the Phan-Site!"
"This way, we can resolve these requests and
make progress in our infiltration at the same
time!"
"Sounds like our hands are starting to get full.
Let's do our best out there, everyone!"
Oh! I almost forgot...
"Here ya go! That no-good Desire-pocketing
Shadow dropped it!"

"Thanks, Mona-chan. I can't wait for our first
cooking lesson together!"
Here's the recipe we'll be working with.
"Great, we're all set on Haru's end. Next up:
getting Futaba on board!"
"Don't you worry—I'll jump in there if you guys
need it! You'll be helping just by being there."
0
"There shall be no Zenkichi-teaching until
you prove your curry and ramen are truly
up to snuff!"
O...kay?
"It's a classic Kyoto approach, similar to farm-
to-table experiences. It uses a variety of local
vegetables and seafood, nothing overly fancy."

"Wrappin' up our trip with a fireworks show like
that was sooo badass!"
"Man, this summer mighta been wild, but it was
just as much of a blast as last year."
"It's like I'm never bored when you're around...
Thanks, [1B]S1."
"Here, dude! I got ya somethin'."
It's a Featherman mask...
"I saw a stall sellin' 'em earlier. I got you Red,
since you're our leader an' all."
Thanks.
Now we're a pair.
I dunno...
"Haha, sure! I know it's kinda kiddie stuff, but
it's nice gettin' a souvenir you can have fun
with, yeah?"
"Right! I've got Yellow, so I'll be your right hand
man!"
"Aw c'mooon, Just take it! It's actually pretty
well-made."
"When I saw those masks, I remembered...
Those superhero teams are strong because
they stick together and fight for each other."
"So, let's hang onto these and wear 'em to
next year's festival, too!"
"Heh, ya promise, right?"
"So, you're Red, I'm Yellow, I'd say Morgana's
Black, and Yusuke's prolly Blue..."
"But who'd be Pink? All the girls on our team're
a bit too... You know... Scary."

"Although it is kinda sad, too... A sign that
summer's coming to an end."
"Still this summer's been such an amazing
whirlwind... thanks to you coming back, [1B]S1."
"Sooo, this is for you!"
It's a colorful bracelet...
Thank you.
"Wow, this looks great."
When did you make this?
"Aw, it was pretty easy to make. There are
plenty of how-to videos online."
"Aw, it was pretty easy to make. There are

"Oh, here and there, bit by bit over the course
of the trip—sometimes when I'd wake up
before everyone else."
"I made one for everybody! Thank goodness
I finished them all before we split up for
the summer."
"You know, if you make a wish when you put it
on, then wear it until it falls off, your wish'll
come true? What do you wanna wish for?"
I wished for all of our dreams to come true.
"Oh, and of course, that the Phantom Thieves
would reunite again someday real soon!"
"We just have to go on another trip like this
sometime! Ya promise we will?"
"Oh, I got this for us too—just a little something
for our Yokohama trip."
"Let's put it on the RV fridge for the final stretch
home! Maybe we can even put it up in Leblanc
once we're back."
"So, where should we go for our next trip?
Ooh! What about overseas!?"

"What was supposed to be a simple summer
vacation in Tokyo turned into a cross-country
road trip... "
"What an adventure. I'm pretty sure I netted
enough driving experience to quell any fears
I may have had behind the wheel, too."
"Thanks for driving, by the way."
Can you drive the next trip too?
I want to drive next time.
"I must say, I had a great time doing it. Hopefully
I can make use of the experience in the future."
"Um, I think I'd prefer you take the wheel next
time... I'd like to try relaxing in the passenger
seat for once."
"Smart. If we had two drivers switching off,
we could cover a lot more distance."
"Oh, before I forget... I'd like you to have this."
"It's a keychain of the
Phantom Thieves logo..."
"Zenkichi-san gave it to me before we left Osaka.
He said it was from Akane-chan."
"He gave me two of them and said they're a
thank-you gift for helping with Akane-chan's
studies. It just feels right for you to have one."
"We may not have been able to reveal our
secret identities to her, but I hope we can
tell her someday, at least."
"You know, the way she feels about the Phantom
Thieves? The rest of the Thieves feel the same
way about you."
"If you're ever feeling all alone, you can look at
that and remember we'll always have your back,
[1B]S1."
"Let's all go back and visit Akane-chan
together sometime."

I'm glad everyone was able to put up with

"I had so much fun. Thank you, truly."
Right back at you.
No need to be so formal.
We sure did go through a lot...
"My only regret is not lending a hand with the
driving. I'll be able to help there next time,
though."
"*giggle* Sorry. I really do mean it, though."

I'm sure everyone's grateful for what you've
done—I know I am."

"I bought it back in Sapporo as a thank-you

"It's Mari-san's favorite brand—and, see the
flower on it?"
"That's called both salvia and sage. It represents

marvelous."

"Phew, am I glad I'm outta that thing now!
I was gettin' all sweaty in my sash zone."
......
"Say, [1B]S1... Do you think I grew
any on this trip?"
I'd say so.
You'll find out soon enough.
"Wait, are you taller now?"
"Aw, yeah! I sure went outside my comfort zone
a whole lot for being an ex-shut-in, didn't I?"
"Ain't that the truth... Once we get back from
summer vacation, I'll be putting my experience
to the test real soon!"
For real!? I finally got my growth spurt!?
"Hang on, I didn't mean my body! I meant, like,
my other stats."
"I did just fine in that crowd earlier. Visiting
a city I'd never seen before, meeting new
people and growing close to them..."

right about it!"

were in my corner—including you. Thanks, [1B]S1."
Welllll... this is for you.

It says ""Safe Family"" on it..."
"I used to have it hanging in my room, but

it does you some good."

"Okay, let's discuss the plan."
"You want to infiltrate the castle in the Sendai
Jail, right?"
"Yup—that bullshit ""overlord"" Natsume's place.
Let's get this shit done right!"
"We go through the ""Gate of Trials"" to get to
the castle, right? And to do that, we needed
three... proofs?"
"Exactly, and now we've got them. They were the
three cores of the keep."
The time's finally come...
"There may be an awful lot of Shadows, but all
we can do is fight our way to the top!"
"Let us know when you're ready to depart.
Be sure to stock up on all the necessary
supplies."
"Now we've got all three cores in Sapporo's
Jail!"
"We avoided a blizzard trap in the keep, as well.
I would expect the Jail's guards are growing
concerned."
"One of the cores was the mayor's badge.
That proves Hyodo basically sees herself
as the head of town."
"Now that we have all three of them, the walls
blocking the path should be melted, right?"
"Yup! And if the pattern established in the
other Jails is any indication, we should be
able to reach the castle now."
"Today'll be our last day in Osaka too.
Better make sure we can leave with
no regrets!"
"Then why don't we check it out! It's over by
the Former Government Office, right?"
"...No, it's nothing. Let's all be sure to rest up for
tomorrow."
"You mean the castle in the direction of
Sapporo's former government office?
That must be where Mari-san is..."
"It's freezing in the Jail, so let's not push ourselves too hard. We can always take a break when we're tired!"
"...Right. Okay guys, let's head to the infiltration
point at Central Street and shake things up!"
"There might be another one of the Fearsome
Four waiting for us. Let's make sure we're
prepared before we go."
"C'mon, guys! That second orb's waiting for us!
We're off to the land of rain!"
"All that's left is sending Alice her calling card!
Then, we jump in that Jail and take her on!"
"Remember, once we send the card out, there's
no turning back. Let's make sure we're ready
first."
A HUNCH!?
"Welp, didn't expect to hear that from an AI,
no matter what its specs are."
"Well... Maybe an AI comes up with better
hunches than humans do?"
"Back to the topic at hand—we need to find
whatever it is that lets us get past the barrier."
"The voices we heard there made it sound like
she was bullied while she was in school."
"Yeah, and according to that detective dude,
the school was Shujin, of all places."
"Sounds like we're heading to school!
Who knows what we'll find out..."
"All right—next, let's go over what we need to do."
"Let's head there once we've concluded our
break."
"Most likely—it sure gives off the same kind of
signal, anyway."
"Which means yet another metric crap-ton of
Shadows waiting for us. Better get ready, guys."
Right! We don't have any time to waste!
"It was one of the dresses Alice sells. It's
supposed to represent the Monarch's
power, right?"
"One of the dresses Alice designed... A source
of power in more ways than one."
"And based on what I'm finding, it looks like
we've got two more keeps to deal with. The
next closest one's near Miyamae Park."
"All right, lets head out once we're ready.
Don't forget to gather what we need through
Sophia."
"That stairway by the east exit of Shibuya
Station's connected to the dump we ditched."
"That tower's just too suspicious—but I bet
security's real tight there... "
"Smart bet. Good luck and keep up the great
work, folks!"
0
"We should probably scout the area once we
get there. I wonder if there'll be any way we
can gain some elevation..."
"Well, what say we find out for ourselves?
Let's head to the spot on the map that
I just marked and take a look around!"
"Aw, c'mon! We're back in the saddle, thievin'
around! You tellin' me you're not feelin' it too?"
"I must say I agree—and somehow, despite all
we've been through, these are still such new
experiences for us."
"All right... I know what you mean, but let's focus
on the task at hand first. "
"Of course! I mean— Uh, roger that, Chief of
Operations!"
"*sigh* Nice try, I suppose... We can keep
working on it in the Jail."
"Good point, we'll need to be focused while
we're in the Metaverse. Let's remember to
take breaks when needed, too."
"Yeah, huh. Can't do any of that stuff
once the Jails are gone for good."
"And sure enough, we can still open EMMA
on our phones..."
"Maybe someone jacked the server? But...
that wouldn't explain how they reactivated
it at all..."
"Futaba, you said this was like sci-fi...?
Is it possible EMMA's new master may not
be human?"
"Man, none of this crap makes sense!
Sophia's even sayin' she's sensing a Jail!"
"Yes... and I've never felt a Jail this big.
It's covering Yokohama, and extends all the
way to Tokyo."
"Not only that, but I think it's getting bigger..."
What in the world is going on...?
"And Tokyo Radio Tower... that's both the
center of the new Jail and EMMA's data center,
right?"
Yes. I doubt that's a coincidence. 
"Only one way to find out. Our next
destination's the Tokyo Radio Tower."
"This time, once we leave, there's no
going back. We'd better make sure we
have everything we could need first."
"Hey, let's stay on track here, guys.
We gotta figure out our next move."
"Right. The Metaverse is encroaching on
reality itself. At this rate, it's gonna engulf
the whole country."
"And that'll mean everyone will have their
Desires stolen. We have to stop that
at all costs."
"If we want to do that... we'll have to
defeat EMMA."
"Yeah! So, this big evil box is at the top of
Tokyo Radio Tower?"
"Most likely. That's where the voice is
coming from."
"Then let's grab what we need and get going.
All right, guys, this is gonna be our last battle."
Let's stay sharp! 
"Despite everything, it looks like I can still
access the online shop, so... just let me
know if you need some supplies."
"Indeed. We must reach the public through
their smartphones, and remind them of
their own true Desires."
"Doing that should remove them, leaving
the way open to EMMA."
"Okay, so... Everyone's already glued to their
smartphones, right? That means we just
gotta hack the app!"
"Then we give everyone a blast of our
calling card, and boom, their Desires
pop out!"
"The problem is, that means everything hinges
on whether Oracle can hack into EMMA...
You think you can do it?"
"I mean... whether I think I can or not,
I've gotta do it, or we're toast. Right?"
"Fair point, I guess. But if anyone can
do it, it's our resident genius hacker!"
"...Are you okay, Oracle? You seem a little tense."
"Thanks, Sophie... but I'm fine. Totally fine.
I'll make it work."
"Sorry we can't help, Oracle. Right now,
all we can do is count on you."
"Okay, let's head out to the server room
once we're ready. We're sending out a
calling card to the entire population!"
Hell yeah! It's left that boxy bastard wide open!
Now we just need to head to the ark itself.
"EMMA's not gonna look so godly when
we beat the crap out of it!"
Right!
So it all comes down to this final battle.
Yes. Let's make sure we're all ready.
"EMMA and I are both AI, but it's taking
everyone's Desires away."
"If you take people's Desires, you take their
hope. And if I'm humanity's companion...
I can't let that happen!"
"We have to stop this, for good!"
"All right, guys... Let's do it!"
"If that is the case, then we simply cannot let it be. There's a chance it could cause even bigger problems in the near future."
"Sophia, you mentioned we can visit the
Shibuya Jail from Sendai, correct?"
"Correct. We can't visit Shibuya physically,
however. Only the Jail."
"I suppose we don't know the exact reason why
that's possible, but we should use it to our
advantage and try to find out what's going on."
"Mhm. So, on our way to Sapporo, we found a
Jail at Sendai in Miyagi."
We also figured out that the Monarch was author Ango Natsume. He's been stealing Desires and forcing others to become his fans.
"Right. And we managed to break into his Jail, but with the ""Gate of Trials"" closed up, we're still blocked off from the Overlord's Castle."
"To open the gate, we'll need three samples of
""proof."" I'm guessing those are the cores, which are being kept in the Prison Keeps."
"According to the novel that Yusuke read, we
need 2 orbs to get the Prison Keep's gate open."
"We have the Sun orb already, right? It said the
next orb should be at the ""land of the rain""..."
"I'm trying to remember what the first of the
Fearsome Four's name was... Dolly, was it?"
I believe it was Doga.
Huh? I thought it was Dola.
"He called himself, Doma."
...
"L-Leaving that aside, we should be able to move
on now. Let's head to the Prison Keep."
"The core's a copy of his book? Talk about
narcissistic."
"I guess that'd make sense. I mean, you all saw
how smug he was."
"The next one is supposed to be somewhere past
the land of rain, correct?"
"If it follows the book Yusuke read, then, yes, that
should be the case."
"But we first gotta get those ""tri-color orbs"" and
open the matching doors, right?"
"Probably, yeah. Games are full of that kinda crap."
Games? Isn't the Jail based on a novel?
"The story feels more like a game than a novel.
Hopping in and out of different universes fits
super well with video games."
"Either way, let's go and collect those orbs so we
can reach the second Prison Keep."
All right! Then let's gear up and head back in!
"They're run by a publisher that's been around
for a while now. Not only do you earn big, but
your debut's basically a guaranteed success."
"Seriously? Man, maybe I should start writing
novels too... I'll be super rich and popular, right?"
"Not in your wildest dreams, Ryuji..."
Couldn't agree more.
"Typically, in order to write a novel, one must be
both knowledgeable and articulate. But Ryuji's
vocabulary is, well..."
"All right, I get it! Sheesh! Forget I said anything!"
O...kay. Shall we head for the third Prison Keep?
"All right, let's load up and check this place out!"
"Well, we can talk more about that later. Now that
we've sent out the calling card, our focus should
be on Natsume."
"Indeed. Let's head in once we're ready. We must
take back the Desires and stop Natsume from
further committing his evil deeds!"
Damn straight!
"Well, in that case... call us together if
you'd like to go into a Jail. I'll make sure
I'm prepared for an infiltration."
"All right. So once we've done everything we
wanted to do, let's head back to Tokyo."
"Yes, good thinking. I would also like to hear
everyone's thoughts."
"Well... Those who become the Monarch's friend
through EMMA get their Desires taken from
them."
"And, thanks to that, the Monarchs can
manipulate them in real life. It's almost like
they've been brainwashed."
"Natsume's fans are buying his books, even at the
cost of going into debt. In some cases, people are
even committing assault."
"And we're not just gonna sit back and watch.
Meanin' it's the Phantom Thieves time to shine."
"Right. Our goal is to take back the Desires
Natsume stole from everyone."
"Just like in Shibuya, there's sure to be plenty of
Shadows and guards roaming the Jail."
"It couldn't hurt to be prepared. I say we get
ourselves ready before we head in."
So where should we go first?
"If we're going off how things went in Shibuya,
we should probably head to the castle where
the Desires are being held."
"We did see that ominous castle in the distance
earlier. I wonder if that's where Natsume is..."
"That's almost certainly the case. I imagine he's
stealing others' Desires from his throne right
this very moment."
"All right, then. We'll head for the castle first."
"Stay focused, guys. From the looks of it, this Jail's
probably pretty big."
"Are we good on medicine? Just let me know if
you want to order something."
"I wonder if the second core has something
to do with his book too..."
"Well excuse me, it just so happens to be the
most convenient way to travel. Besides, all
you guys have to worry about is sleeping."
0
0
"All right, let's discuss our next moves."
"Oh, settle down... Although, I admit it does
have a nostalgic feeling to it."
"Just to be clear, our objective is changing Alice
Hiiragi's heart, correct?"
"You nailed it—and if we can figure out what
this Jail thing is while we're at it, that's even
better."
"We need to return the Desires Alice took from
those people so they can go back to normal."
"All right. Sit-rep time, guys."
"A set of searchlights are currently preventing
front entrance to Alice's castle."
"Right. At this rate, everyone in the world'll get
turned into Alice's slaves if we don't act soon."
I'll help however I can.
"So the keyword to enter the Jail is
""Wonderland."""
"So, we finally reached Maruku City!"
"Sure woulda been easier to get there in the
real world, where the mobs aren't the hostile kind..."
"Before we use that, though, make sure we have
everything we'll need for the infiltration, got it?"
"All right! Let's dive in the moment we're ready!
Let us know when it's time, Leader! "
"We found a potential alternate path, but the
gunfire indicated it was also a no-go."
"Remind me, where are we to go next?"
"Well, we did spot that rather curious tower off
in the distance."
"That's where I sensed the power source we're
trying to track down—the real problem's the
route getting there."
"According to Futaba, we want to head in the
direction of Maruku City."
"Yep, that's where I sensed the power source
flowing to the searchlights and the turret.
Take out that source and we should be good!"
"A'ight, everyone, let's hammer this out!"
"Well, we finally found the Prison Keep in
Maruku City."
"Sweet! Let's get in there an' eff up that Jail's
power!"
"You sure are pumped, Ryuji..."
"Right, and we have no idea what'll happen then.
Let's make sure we're ready for anything."
"We're really keeping the pace—we've already
reached Miyamae Park."
"The first thing that comes to mind when I hear
""Miyamae Park"" is skateboarding."
"That reminds me, what was with all those awful
police-guys running around?"
"They seemed to be at Alice's beck and call...
Merely more Shadows for us to cut through
should they stand in our way."
"Whatever they are, we'll have to deal with them
once we're back in Maruku City looking for the
power source."
"We have two cores now. Not hard to deduce
there's only one left to take."
"I can't believe how huge this Jail is—and how
many enemies there are in it! I'm pooped."
"With that gate closed as it is, we don't have any
direct route to the tower."
"However, we did locate a tunnel that should
lead to the other side of the gate."
"Yeah, right around where Alice dumped us
when we got caught."
"Man, did that ridiculous-ass cop really get
to me yesterday."
"I know what you mean. He was just so...
whatever about it all—and super shady,
too."
"I suppose we were lucky he didn't decide to
simply bring in [1B]S1 on the spot."
"It's a small relief, but it hasn't bought us all that
much time, when you consider how we need
to change Alice's heart before it's too late..."
"Which means we have to figure out a way past
that gate, no matter what!"
Dude! We did it!
"Excellent work, as usual! Now we can get into
the castle!"
"That's where we found all those Shadows of
people whose Desires had been taken by
Alice's minions."
"I wish there was something we could do for
them—we have to get their Desires back, right?"
"Yeah, they're so defenseless right now,
they'd just get locked back up if we freed
them without handling Alice first."
"All right, let's get to business."
"Alice has hoarded all the Desires she seized
on the roof of her castle."
"We can see them, but we can't reach them
due to some sort of barrier."
"This is likely a barrier erected by the Monarch's
heart, to which we will need to find a ""key""
somewhere..."
"We also discovered a core at the top of the
Prison Keep that served as the power source
to a security system within the Jail."
"Man, I heard the skate park there got shut
down! So lame!"
"You can still skate in the Jail version of the park.
No one issues citations in the Metaverse."
"Come on now, we're not touring the Jail for
pleasure. Let's focus on finding that second
keep."
I wonder if there's a core in that keep as well?
"Ah! Lady Ann, it would be my honor for the
Morganamobile to escort you wherever you
may please! You just get your rest!"
"Well... That infiltration may have had some
twists to it, but at least we can progress now."
What was with that axe maniac in there?
"It was clearly guarding the key we were
after, but exactly WHAT it was, we haven't
the foggiest..."
"You're easier to read than a book, Cat..."
"Let's remember to keep our eye on our health
and such while we traverse the Jail."
"Since a calling card only affects a target for so
long, we have to finish this right away."
0
"The question now is whether or not the Desires
will take form like the Treasures did."
"Only one way to find out. We came this far, so
there's no point in thinkin' too hard about it."
"Yeah, let's go! We need to change Alice and her
victims back to normal!"
"Okay, let's go over our current situation before
heading out."
"So our next location is Sapporo, correct? We just
need to get there by August 8th?"
"Yes, but the Change of Heart incidents are
happening all around the country. Perhaps
another one will occur on the way there."
"A Jail has a unique scent. If I happen to notice
one, I'll let you all know."
"Wait... Whaddya mean ""scent""? Aren't you an AI?"
"Let's have a quick meeting before we enter the
Jail."
"We obtained the keyword to become friends
with Natsume Ango, who's most likely the
Monarch of the Sendai Jail."
Right. All thanks to Inari.
"We won't know until we actually see the Jail, but
from the way things look, it's safe to say he's the
one heading it."
"Just to make sure we are all on the same page,
perhaps we should revisit why we need to
infiltrate these Jails in the first place."
Time for a quick meetin'!
"We successfully infiltrated Natsume's Jail. But
this is only the beginning."
"We can also swap out as needed. I am happy
to contribute however you'd like."
"The third tower's over at Bunkamachi. We can
get there via Central Street."
"Good job making it through that waterway, guys!"
"Okay, guys. Time for a meeting."
"We've been at it for quite some time. I suppose
it would be a good idea to see where we're at."
"There're a lotta Shadows there too. Try not to get
ambushed."
"Thank goodness we didn't have to swim...
Even if my vent-crawling skills are a bit rusty."
"I'm sure dashing around giant sewer pipes is
something only a phantom thief could pull off."
"Well, it wasn't easy, but we somehow managed
to snag both the Sun orb and the Rain orb."
"Hell yeah! Now we can get into the first Prison
Keep!"
"Today was full of many firsts for me. It was quite
fun."
"Yeah, I guess programs don't really do this
kinda stuff, do they?"
"You did an excellent job too, Futaba! As well as
our decoys, Sophia and [1B]S1."
"We managed to obtain the first core of the
Sendai Jail."
"Natsume's novel, ""Prince of Nightmares,"" seems
to be part of his power source."
No prob. I'm just glad I could help.
"Well, our next step is to dive deeper into enemy
territory. It'd be best for us to prepare as much
as possible."
"So, we're getting closer to the Monarch, huh?
Just a bit longer, Alice..."
Okay. Time for another meeting.
"We're currently headed to the second Prison
Keep to obtain the next core..."
"Most likely, a location within the real world,
rather than the Jail."
"Okay, and, uhhh... what is it that makes you
think that, again?"
......
We've finally procured the second core.
"It was a Soukaisha Awards trophy... I wonder if
those are well known."
A hunch.
"If we were in another part of the Jail, what
exactly is a Jail supposed to be?"
"Shadows affecting humans in the real world,
a Metaverse realm with separated sections
and a barrier built out of trauma..."
"Huh... So we can go from Sendai to the Shibuya
Jail just like that."
But how...? Are the Jails connected?
"At the very least, all the Desires in the Shibuya
Jail are finally free..."
"Why don't we check out the requests? Perhaps
we can gather some more information."
0
"All right, we've reached the birdcage of the
Sendai Jail. Next up's the Trauma Room."
"We heard the voices of the editors, and found
out that the place is called ""Gatorre Coffee."""
"I'm sure it's somewhere in Sendai, but... I
wonder if we'll be able to get inside like we did
in Shibuya."
I'm sure we will be okay. We should be able to enter the Trauma Room if we use the keyword at the specified location.
"These Jails sure are different from the Palaces
we've seen."
Feel like chattin' before we hit the sack?
"I hadn't guessed that Natsume was being used by
his editors..."
"Yeah, but that's no reason to take people's
Desires and brainwash them."
"I wonder how Alice and Natsume obtained their
power..."
"We can mull that over later. For now, let's focus
on changing Alice's heart."
"Natsume's seen the calling card. The Desires have
surely materialized by now."
"Don't you guys think Zenkichi went kinda
overboard with how many calling cards he put
up?"
"Shit, that was funny! Gramps's kinda ballsy, huh?"
"Yeah, if we can even get into that cage now..."
"All right, guys! Let's do this!"
"All right guys. Let's go over what's happened so
far and what our next steps are."
"Firstly, we successfully managed to change Ango
Natsume's heart."
"The frenzy throughout the city died down, and
the fans turned back to normal."
"And we met the developer of EMMA, that
Ichinose lady, at the lecture at Toho University."
"She sure was strange... Pretty amazing that she's
the one who created EMMA, though, huh?"
"Hooray! We made it to the northern highlands
of Sapporo!"
"It's much cooler here than back in the city.
The air feels cleaner too."
"Either way, there's no doubt it'll be a long trip.
Let's make sure we're prepared."
"We won't be able to come back to Shibuya for a
while, so be sure to check everything you can...
That's how they do it in RPGs, anyway."
"Trauma Room, huh...? Sounds kinda lame. I'll try to think up something better."
"All right. Time to hit the streets for rumors about
Hyodo."
"I can't believe the Monarch's the mayor...
How many thousands of hearts you think she's
changed by now?"
"Back in Shibuya, there was that warden-like
creature, but is it possible there's one here as
well?"
"...Maybe. We might have a fight on our hands.
Make sure you guys are ready."
0
"All right, let's set up a meeting!"
"Now that we have Hyodo's keyword, all that's
left is infiltrating her Jail."
"I have no clue... But I do know that, right now, we need to stop him!"
"You're right. If we don't do something soon the
number of victims will keep increasing."
"By the way, do you think it was okay to leave the posting of the calling cards to Zenkichi?"
O-O-Okay... L-L-Let's get started...
"What's wrong, Futaba? Are you okay?"
"It shouldn't be an issue. I'm sure he doesn't want
to lose his end of the deal."
Be pretty lame if we're the only ones handlin' all this. Least we can do is let him send a message.
"I see... So that is what you call a ""deal."" Seems I've learned something new yet again."
Let us devise a plan.
"So we were close to infiltrating the castle, but
then the ice walls got in our way."
"It seems like we need to go around somehow.
Let's look for other possible routes."
"Either way, once we've finished getting ready,
we'll probably want to go right to sleep. We take
action tomorrow."
"He was trying to help a lost child the other day,
too... Maybe he's actually a nice person."
"All right, planning time!"
"We managed to get the first core, but then a
sudden snowstorm stopped us in our tracks."
...That kid seemed to think otherwise.
"I don't think we can fully trust him just yet, but...
I'd say it's safe to assume he's on our side."
"Yeah, but then again, she ended up sellin' it to
Madicce. Can't help wonderin' if she's smart or
just plain weird."
Let's work out the current situation.
"Whatever she may be, we made a deal with her.
Maybe with this, we'll be able to wrap our heads
around this EMMA situation a little bit better."
0
"Our next destination is... Sapporo Central,
correct?"
"Yes. It appears Zenkichi has been keeping an eye
on someone there, very likely a Monarch."
"All right, let's call a quick meeting before we hit
the castle!"
"...I must say, I find Hyodo's treatment of her
staff members appalling."
"I wonder if this person is changing hearts on a
scale where even the police would be alerted."
"That could very well be... But at any rate, we
need to see for ourselves."
Let's go to Hokkaido as soon as we're ready.
"Let's review our situation before going into
Hyodo's Trauma Cell."
0
"Hokkaido is famous for its bountiful seafood.
Then it's settled; we will have sushi platters—
no, a sashimi course for lunch!"
"No way. Hokkaido's more known for it's ramen,
and that ain't changin'."
"Come on, boys. We're here for the Monarch of
Sapporo, not to fill your empty stomachs. Now
Sophia, you smell a Jail here, right?"
"So there was another warden in that Trauma
Cell. Feels like they're getting tougher every
city."
"You're right... I wonder if those wardens get
stronger as the Monarch's trauma gets worse."
"Yes, and it reeks."
"First Shibuya, then Sendai, and now Sapporo...
This region's pretty vast, so it's gonna be tough
to find."
"Hey, before all that, why don't we go take a bath?"
Maybe we should talk before headin' to bed.
"You think we're askin' too much outta Gramps?
I mean, we made him do the calling card again."
"Sounds good to me, especially since we're all
icky from yesterday. Hard to gather intel when
you're covered in a day's worth of sweat."
"Okay. I marked the bathhouse on the map.
Whenever you're ready, we'll go."
......
Meeting time!
"Let's start by recalling that Hyodo saw our
calling card, meaning the Desires should have
taken form by now."
"Really, Ryuji?"
...Sorry. Kinda spoke without thinkin' there.
"No, it's okay. No matter what I feel, it doesn't
change the fact that Mari-san's our target."
"All right, let's hop to it."
"Now that Hyodo-san's had a change of heart,
everyone in town is back to normal!"
"Why's the mayor so tough on her own staff?
She was losing it over, what, a flower?"
"Even with the election coming up, she seemed
unusually agitated."
"She used to be so kind and wonderful to
everyone... I just don't understand."
"Oh, is it meeting time?"
"Not quite. I just wanted to talk about what our
plan is from here."
"Maybe whatever changed her has to do with why
she became a Monarch. In any case, let's find out
what we can about her."
"Our objective is to take back everyone's Desires
from Hyodo-san and return them to their
owners, yeah?"
"Correct. She may be Haru's old acquaintance,
but she's changing people's hearts in order to
garner votes."
"Guys! Can you believe it!? We're IN Okinawa
right now!"
"I love soaking up all this sun... I guess this is why
they say it's always summer here."
"Also... I don't know why, but she was super harsh
on that one city council guy."
"He was loading himself up on medicine in order
to keep working. At this rate, her entire staff
could collapse any minute."
"The people aren't normal either. They don't pay
any attention to that sort of behavior, and seem
to worship Hyodo instead."
I think it's time we gather around.
"Gather 'round for what? We're havin' the time
of our lives right now."
"Seriously, it was like a cult gathering in front of
her election poster. So freaky..."
...We should get going.
"Mari-san is putting people in her Jail, stealing
their Desires, and leaving them brainwashed."
"Seems like this area's still safe. Let's go over our
current situation."
"I'd say that's a good idea, now that Sophia's back
with us."
I can't let that continue.
It's too cold in the Jail and too hot outside... Sudden changes in temperature get me bamboozled.
"It was a frigid, heartless prison, as if symbolizing
the winter of Hokkaido."
"Okay! Let's go over what happened and figure
out what to do from here."
We located a USB drive at the research lab with a list of the people whose hearts have been forcibly changed.
"The castle in the distance looked like there was
a knife and a fork going through it. What could
that mean?"
"I dunno. Maybe 'cause she eats Hokkaido miso
ramen with a knife and fork?"
"Ah, okay. Got it!"
"Okay guys. Let's go over the plan before we
head after Akane."
"Don't you think it's cool Zenkichi has a Persona
too!?"
"Don't let your stupidity rub off on her, Ryuji.
Now c'mon, let's decide our course of action."
"We should head for the castle in the Jail first.
That's where the Desires and the Monarch are."
"Oh, Ryuji."
"Oookay! Let's have a quick meeting before we
do our infiltration!"
"Man, this place is packed. It's got people,
shops, all kindsa food... Guess this really
is Osaka, huh?"
What?
"That Jail's gonna turn me into an icicle...
Do you have any heating pads?"
Why would I when it's so frickin' hot outside?
"Okay, guys. Let's have a little meeting about the
Osaka Jail."
"Compared to how lively the real Osaka is, this
place is a dystopian nightmare."
"I noticed the tall Madicce building looming in
the distance... I wonder if Konoe designed it
that way on purpose."
"Oh, but here's an idea! Why don't we cook us up
some hot food at the RV?"
"Hot food, you say... Ooh, you mean curry!?
Please say it's curry!"
"We've obtained our first core. With that, the
machine guns should be silenced."
"Mhm. Now we can move on from Shinsekai to
the castle."
"I'm pretty sure he's got ramen on his mind
instead. But don't let that take away your smile,
Futaba."
"Thanks to those heaters, we managed to get
through it. But now we need to watch out for
the Prison Keep lying ahead."
"The core we found was Mari-san's election
poster. Is this the source of her power...?"
"Okay, it's meeting time."
"We can't get any closer to the castle with all
those infrared sensors blocking the way."
"Very likely, yes. Though I cannot say why she's
so obsessed over her position as mayor."
"Is that why she treats her staff so hard? 'Cause
she thinks she has to be a tyrant? Either way,
that can't be all there is to it."
"Let's just head over to the second Prison Keep
for now. Seems like the ice walls melt whenever
we nab a core."
All right. Time to come up with a plan.
"So the second core turned out to be EMMA
itself. Fitting, since that's Konoe's personal
power source in the real world too."
"You're right. Then let's focus on the second
one and make that our objective."
"Okay. We'll begin as soon as we're ready.
Security is tight, so stay on guard, everyone!"
"We were able to get the core from the second
Prison Keep. It was a beautiful flower."
Strategy time.
"I know we're real close to the castle now, but
what was it they said about an airship?"
"It resembled those we saw at the former
government office, an enduring landmark
of Hokkaido's history and culture."
"Is that why she got so upset over the wilted
flower?"
"Possibly, but I think it's more than that. After all,
she's overworking her entire staff, not just the
one at the garden."
"All right. Let's go over what we know before
heading back in."
"So the hero show we heard in the Jail was
the talk show happening on this side."
"What could be motivating Hyodo to do all this...
I guess the answer lies deeper within the Jail."
"In any case, our next destination is set:
the third Prison Keep."
"Okay, ready to see some action. Shall we go?"
"Perhaps we should review our strategy before
we enter the Trauma Cell."
"Based on what we heard from the birdcage,
Akira Konoe was... Uhm..."
"Yeah, her whole ""work till you drop"" mentality
reminds me of a dictator!"
"I'm glad we took that staff member to the
hospital. Otherwise, he really might've
collapsed from fatigue."
......
"All right, everybody. Quick huddle before
we send our calling card!"
Man... Why'd I get stuck writing this thing...?
"Try not to let it get to you, Haru. I understand
how you might be feeling, but Hyodo's our
target right now."
"Yes... You're right. If we don't change Mari-san's
heart, there will only be more victims."
"Saving people from danger in the Metaverse is
something only we can achieve. I know it's hard,
but let's keep moving forward."
"I'd say that calling card was a great
success!"
"Heheheh! We scattered those babies all over
Osaka. No way Konoe's gonna miss that!"
"Our next destination is the castle. I think more
powerful enemies are gonna start showing up."
"That is to be expected. Let's prepare well before
continuing on."
"Based on the voices we heard at the birdcage,
I think the snow sculpture incident from two
years ago had to have been involved."
"Man... I guess our trip really is gonna be
over soon, huh?"
"Miyagi, Hokkaido, Okinawa, Fukuoka, Kyoto, and
Osaka... All remarkable places indeed."
"A nine-year-old girl even lost her life... And
because it was sponsored by the city, all fingers
pointed to the one directly in charge."
"It was reported as an ""act of god""—an accident
where no parties are held responsible. So how
could this be the Monarch's source of trauma?"
"I wonder if that voice was the mother of the girl
who lost her life. She really seemed to have it
out for Mari-san..."
"Okay, now we've got Zenkichi here too."
"Yeah. So, just to make sure we're all on
the same page..."
"EMMA's up and running again. No idea how,
but there it is. Nobody in Madicce or
the police knows how to shut it down."
"I heard another weird voice in there too,
complainin' about his pay or some shit?"
"There has to be more to this than we know.
Let's go to the Trauma Cell and investigate!"
"・退行について
・なぜジェイルが？"
・とにかく先へ進んでみよう
"We'll need to go to where this incident took
place. Should be within this park."
"It's probably safe to assume that a warden'll be
there waiting for us. Be ready for anything, guys."
"That aside, we now know there was more to
the Monarch's trauma as we suspected."
"Okay! Time for our strategy meeting before
we go take down this fake god!"
"Kinda feels weird, being in the RV in our
Phantom Thieves gear..."
"Right. The main thing I'm getting out of this
is that one of the city employees was taking
bribes, or kickbacks, as he called it."
"Technically, the contractors who built the
snow sculpture would be the ones at fault
here. Either way, it ended up in an accident."
...One that made a nine-year-old girl lose her life.
"A refreshing juxtaposition. Not something we
experience everyday, at least."
"I never thought I'd be able to ride the RV
like this, either..."
"Mari-san knows the truth. But her staff and the
senior councilman are essentially blackmailing
her..."
"Saying if she reports it, they're gonna blame it all
on her."
"What the hell! So you're tellin' me those
council dudes are the real bad guys, not the
mayor herself?"
"Let's review our situation before sending
out the calling card."
"Everyone's Desires are shielding EMMA.
We can't get near it."
"If we want to break through, we must
force the captive Desires to materialize,
and restore their independence."
"That would certainly make things simpler, but we
cannot overlook the fact that Hyodo is currently
seizing Desires from the populace."
"We'll just have to keep the two things separate.
Our target right now is the one doing evil in the
Metaverse!"
"Now, let's have a quick meeting before
we get to the final battle."
"They saw our calling card, all right...
The plan went perfectly!"
Yes... I agree with Mona-chan.
But then...
"What is it, Haru?"
"So there're people who haven't gotten their
Desires back from the Shibuya Jail yet, huh...?"
"You're sayin' some people are still bein' forced
to love Alice?"
"The Desires should've gone back to their owners
after the birdcage fell apart... Maybe we missed
some of them?"
"Well, we are in charge of the Metaverse...
Maybe we can just make him in charge of
the real world stuff, like calling cards?"
"I suppose that is how a deal would work...
But maybe we did twist his arm a little bit."
"Do you really think it's okay to make a
policeman leave our calling cards?"
"Under normal circumstances, maybe not. But
there are more important things at stake than
preserving every aspect of the law."
"There's no turning back once the calling card is
out. Are you ready for this, Haru?"
"Yes, I believe so... Though I could really use a bit
of encouragement."
Why do you need encouragement?
"Oh, don't worry—I shouldn't have said anything.
Anyway, I'll get the calling card ready."
"Now all that's left is heading to the birdcage,
keeping in mind she'll most surely try to stop us."
"Then let's get going, everyone."
"If we run away when confronted with difficulty,
we'll never be able to help those who are dear
to our hearts... This time, I'm standing firm."
"Well said, Haru!"
"Wow, someone's all pumped up! I better not lag
behind!"
"Her expression is fierce and determined... What
could this possibly mean?"
"Mwehehe, maybe something interesting
happened last night? Aaaanyhoo, let's
mosey on over to that Jail!"
"Hyodo stated that she's going to aim for
re-election. I'd say that's how it should be."
"I agree. The way Hyodo-san is now, I'm sure
she'll make Sapporo an even better place
than it is now... And it's all thanks to Haru."
"Oh, no. This only happened because everyone
supported me. Thank you all so much for
helping Mari-san, too."
"You look so much happier, Haru. I think it's
spreading to me, too."
"Sooo... Now we're just waitin' on Gramps to
finish interrogating Hyodo-san, yeah?"
"Yep. Heard he's also getting her smartphone.
Hopefully we'll get some new intel..."
"Well, either way, it's probably gonna be awhile.
Let's just enjoy our free time for now."
"Good idea! Oh, why don't we check out what
Sapporo's like at night?"
"Ooh, nice! All right, Leader, just let us know
when you wanna hit the town!"
"Our next destination is the research lab in
Okinawa."
"According to Ichinose, that's where Madicce
could've altered EMMA."
"Whether its potential alteration correlates to the
appearance of Jails or not, there's only one way
to find out."
"But we're actually headed to Kyoto, right?"
"Mmhm. It's so Zenkichi-san can stop by the
Kyoto Police Department, and so we can
take the direct ferry to Okinawa from Kobe."
"Zenkichi, you seem restless."
"Yeah, you've had a bug up your butt ever since
that one phone call... Do you really gotta tag
along with us?"
"Correct—Futaba has marked the place for us
on the map. We should check that area first."
"I'm rather grateful that you'll be the one
taking the wheel."
"All right. Once we're ready, we leave Sapporo.
Be sure not to forget anything."
"Everything here is so beautiful.
Even the air feels fresh and clean!"
"Ah... This is certainly a paradise for the senses.
No, not a paradise—it is heaven on earth!"
"All we've been doing lately is fighting, so this
might be just the break we need. Although, we
should probably discuss what's at hand first."
"Right. Our objective here is to locate Madicce's
research lab, which should be somewhere on
the island."
"Even though the population here is pretty
low, there's still plenty of people we can ask
about the lab's whereabouts."
"I'm sorry I can't be of any help. Because this
facility is unlisted, I am incapable of navigating
us there."
"Don't sweat it, Sophia. After all, it is a secret lab!
Having it just pop up on the map would be no
fun."
You really think so?
"Heck yeah! Then let's get out there and find that
secret lab!"
"I wouldn't mind having a meeting in our bathing
suits. It might actually be refreshing."
"You're right. We should be proactive in thinking
outside the box, from an artistic perspective as
well as from a philosophical standpoint..."
"Oookay, Inari, let's stop you right there. We
don't have an eternity to listen to you ramble."
"Back to the topic, the research facility staff is
returning tomorrow, correct?"
"Uh-huh. Zenkichi was saying he'll talk to them
once they're back."
"Depending on what we find out, we may just
discover the connection between the lab and
all these Jails."
"The research laboratory is where they altered
EMMA in some way..."
"Eh, we'll find out the deets tomorrow, one
way or another. Let's just enjoy the beach for
now!"
"I suppose it's important to change up the pace
every once in a while. Now that the sun has
set, perhaps we should get some dinner ready."
"...I'm sorry about earlier. I just had to know who
was calling me."
"Hey, no worries. If anything, we're here to help."
"So what exactly's going on here? For
someone who was waiting outside,
this isn't making much sense."
"...They definitely experimented with EMMA and
Jails here."
We heard voices like that from the tapes.
"You mean, like, from a tape recorder? Those
things still exist?"
"Based on the tapes' content, this Jail reflects the
cognition of those associated with the research."
"I'm sure we'll come across more data as we
progress. Right now, we're thinking the
Monarch is Shuzo Ukubata."
"We aren't sure whether he's changed the hearts
of the locals or not... But either way, there are
Desires that need releasing."
"We also need to discover who was calling out to
Sophia."
"If we're done here, let's get going. The islanders
could come attack us any minute."
"We'll probably be able to reach the tower once
we get to the surface."
"In other words, we've realized there is a
mastermind who would benefit from
changing those people's hearts."
"And to find that mastermind, I'm gonna figure
out who stands the most to benefit. That being
said, I need to go work on my own for a bit."
"Whatcha gonna do? Need me to hack some
databases?"
"I'd rather not ask you to do something blatantly
illegal. But don't worry, the police database I
can access should give me plenty to work with."
"Nice. Then Gramps, we leave that to you.
Metaverse stuff is more up our alley anyways."
"So Zenkichi's going straight to Kyoto from
here... and we're going through Kyushu, right?"
"Yes. It's important that we look around and
make sure that there aren't any Jails in that
region as well."
"Then leave it to me. I'll let you all know if I sniff
out a Jail."
"Great. We'll be counting on you, Sophia."
"Then let's head out as soon as we're ready. But
make sure to tie up any loose ends in Okinawa
first. Wouldn't want to leave things undone."
"Yeah, and talk about a badass one! Watchin'
it all go down really shook me up!"
"You rocked it out there, Zenkichi."
"So this is the power you kids were talking
about... If only I could make better use of it."
"But hey, if it helps save Akane, I'll just have to
learn on the go. Hope you thieves don't mind
teaching this old dog here."
"I'm sure you have a lot to teach us, too."
"You know... I admire you for everything you did
for Akane-chan. I'm sure it wasn't easy having
all that on your shoulders."
"But now things are different. At last, you can
unleash your righteous anger on the villains
who crossed your path."
"Yeah, I guess that'll come in time..."
"But first, we need to rescue Akane-chan.
That's our top priority."
"...Right. Sorry to keep asking favors, but I can't
rescue my daughter without you guys!"
"We got you, man!"
"Yeah, leave it to us!"
"Then let's get ready and head out. Akane's
waiting!"
"This was the main avenue of commerce during
the Edo period, after all. You don't get to be the
kitchen of Japan without having all the goods."
"Hey, can't we just get down to business?
We know Konoe's keyword—let's get
inside his Jail already."
"Cool your jets, Zenkichi. We always prep first."
"That so? Well, I guess I don't have the seniority
to whine."
"Hey, I've been wondering... You know how
Konoe's keyword is ""Zephyrman,"" right?"
"Of all things, why'd he pick a TV superhero?"
"Right? That one's so retro, it's vintage—I know
'cause I looked it up. It's just your average TV
show from way back when."
"Maybe it was his favorite series. But I suppose
there's no way to tell right now."
"I'm sure we'll find out as we get through his
Jail. Speaking of which, we can get in at the
Tenboto, right Sophia?"
"Right. We should be able to enter safely from
there. But let's make sure we're ready first."
"That building is probably right where Konoe's
castle is. All we have to do is release those
Desires he took from everyone, right?"
"Correct, though if this Jail is anything like
the others, we'll have to gather cores from
the Prison Keeps first."
Gather what from where now?
"I'll explain later, but basically it's the stuff we
need to enter Konoe's castle."
"I also noticed some machine guns in the Jail
that threaten to hamper our progress."
"Sure is a mild way to put it. If we don't get the
core outta the Prison Keep, those things'll
riddle us with bullets."
"Mm, I kinda forgot about that, since there
weren't any keeps in Okinawa or Kyoto."
"Then let's make a beeline for the first keep.
Security's gonna be tight, so everybody
be on guard."
"The first core we got was Zephyrman, same as
the keyword. But it was just a toy."
"Maybe he REALLY likes superhero shows.
I mean, he loves actin' all heroic and shit, right?"
I don't see Konoe as any sort of hero.
"I imagine some people might. After all, not
everyone sees justice the same way."
"Oh, sorry to change the topic, but wasn't there
something floating in the sky of the Jail?"
"Perhaps it's a blimp... or an airship? We saw it
when we first entered the Jail."
"Whatever it is, you don't see those in the real
world nowadays. I wonder if that's a clue as to
how Konoe thinks..."
"Either way, let's head toward the castle. Maybe
we'll be able to locate the second Prison Keep."
"Yeah... But damn, this sure ain't the Osaka
I know. If this is our future, we're screwed."
"It's probably just Konoe's warped thinking...
Though I wish he hadn't visualized the need
for such wild security measures."
"It's like we got the bad ending to an alternate
future timeline... Hate to say it, but isn't that
kinda cool?"
"Heh, maybe we'll see some badass robots too.
But... doesn't change the fact Konoe's still a
bad guy."
"I find it rather odd that the city in this Jail is so
devoid of life. It's as if it wasn't meant for human
beings."
"Those Monarchs were nothing but tools to him.
It's almost as if he made them to prove a point."
"I'm sure we all have a lot on our minds, but for
now, let's focus on how to keep going."
"Yes, we need to do something about those
sensors. Could it be that the power source
is located in the second Prison Keep?"
"That's likely the case. For now, let's follow the
mark on our map."
"Hard to believe there's a plot twist with that guy.
He's definitely our final boss."
"What I'm curious about is why he's so bent
on portraying himself as a hero."
"He presumes that robbing people of their
will is a just thing to do. Personally, I find
that despicable."
I wonder if there's a Trauma Cell here too...
"Maybe so. We can only determine that by
listening to the voices of the birdcage."
"Oh yeah, those infrared sensors are gone, right?
Then let's get over there."
"Sounds good. We'll head out once we're all
ready!"
"It seems like in order to get to the castle, we'll
have to embark on the airship through the
departure gate."
"""Those who seek an audience with Lord Akira""...
What does he think he is, royalty?"
"Well, it does fit into the naming scheme.
There are Monarchs underneath him, or were."
"Whatever the case may be, we should conclude
that an airship ride is in our near future."
"I highly doubt they'd let us walk right into the
cabin. Let's go back and see if we can't find a
way in."
"It's bullshit how Konoe can throw whatever
shade he wants on us, yet HE'S the one goin'
around stealin' Desires."
"Well, now that that's over with, I'm sure all
the commotion in the Jail has died down."
That means we can finally get in the castle!
"Right. But don't forget we're up against the
creator of all the Jails here. Let's not take this
lightly."
"Nooo problem! I've got the power of tech and
takoyaki on my side!"
"As do I. Whosoever stands against us shall be
stricken severely by our takoyaki-infused might!"
"I know this already, but... you kids are a bunch
of lunatics."
"*chuckle* Shouldn't we be? We are phantom
thieves already. Now then, let's get prepared
and head to that castle!"
"Physically abused by his father, or at least we
can assume that."
...Now's not the time to dwell on it.
"Whether it's the director at Okinawa, his former
Monarchs, or the masses caught in the crossfire,
Konoe's a dangerous man."
"I agree. No matter what his trauma might be,
he needs to be stopped before this gets any
worse."
"Still, I have to wonder why Konoe created a
trauma-based system of imprisonment to
seize other people's Desires."
"Perhaps it has to do something with his own
trauma... Though we won't know for certain
until we've seen it."
0
"Let's head to Konoe's house. We can
decide what to do from there."
"Yeah. Just let me know when you want to
head over. I've already researched where
we need to go."
"There might be a warden present, like before.
Feel free to check my shop if you need anything."
"Better give me some good lines, Gramps.
Somethin' badass!"
"Surely an officer of your abilities can handle
a simple writing assignment. Failure would
be inexcusable."
"Hey, Zenkichi's the big fancy adult here.
I bet he's gonna make us sound awesome!"
"Geez, guys, tone it down with the pressure
already! I told you, I don't know how to
write this stuff!"
"Do you need help, Zenkichi?"
"Bah... no, I'll be fine, Sophia. You just
concentrate on our flight path."
"Once the calling card's done, Zenkichi and
I will go prepare the deployment."
Roger that. Just leave it to me.
"Um... I'm sorry we're putting so much
of this on your shoulders, Zenkichi-san."
"Eh, don't be. After what Konoe did to my
daughter, I'm gonna give him a lot more
than just a letter."
"Besides... Kinda nice to feel relied on,
for once. Even if it's you kids..."
"Seriously, Zenkichi? You can't try to drop
a tough-guy one-liner like that when
you're already turning red!"
"Rrrgh—Fine, never mind! Forget I said anything!
Just shut up and let me write!"
"The Desires that Konoe took should have
materialized now."
"So... all we have to do now is change his
heart, and return everyone's Desires."
"This is it, then. Moment of truth."
"It's not the ""moment of truth"" until we've
got him cornered. We need to make sure
he pays for what he's done."
Hell yeah! Let's do this!
"You know, though, Zenkichi... your calling card
was quite unique."
"Ugh, why'd you have to bring that up again!?
Didn't you guys give me enough crap
for it before!?"
"Well, I thought the wording was rather
striking! Fine work indeed, Zenkichi-san."
"Huh? U-Uh, yeah. Piece of cake...
So would you say it was super cool,
or just regular cool?"
"Wow, it's like she flipped a switch...
Well, I guess that's Zenkichi."
"Okay guys. Let's make this final heist
one to remember."
"It's gonna be a rough battle. Let's make sure
we're all ready."
"It'd be nice to come back sometime.
Hopefully without all the crazy conspiracy stuff."
"We've still got plenty in Japan to see, though.
Maybe next year we could do a cross-country
trip!"
"If we do, we'd better remember to
invite Zenkichi-san and Akane-chan."
"Bah, I wish. Akane can go, but I'll probably be
stuck working. Though... I guess I could
catch up when I find some time."
"Oh hey, Zenkichi... EMMA hasn't stopped yet,
has it?"
"Not yet, no. But once I say the word, the
investigator of the MPD will shut EMMA
down for good."
"Figured you guys might have some loose
ends to finish up in the Jails, or something."
"I'm planning to send in the request once
we leave Osaka. You just say when."
"Ah, all right. That's a relief."
"If you have any requests you want to finish,
now would be a good time to do so."
"Aw man, this RULES! When was the last time we
had a briefin' in a hideout like this!?"
"We got to one of the Prison Keeps earlier, but
that gate was closed too."
"C'mon, you can go shopping any time. Let's just
relax at Leblanc for a bit."
"Man, it sure brings back memories... Still, let's
leave batting for next time."
"Now's not the time to hit baseballs. We have to
go meet Ryuji at Shibuya."
"Now's not the time to be playing around.
We need to prepare for the infiltration."
We can't really mess around till the job's done...
"We didn't end up with much time left over,
huh... We'll have to wait on hitting those
homeruns."
"Cigarettes, huh... I wonder if the chief still
smokes."
"There's a huge variety of cigarettes... I wonder
what the differences are between them?"
"There's nothing for you here. Let's hurry and
head to Takemi's."
"You've got no business here. Let's hurry over
to the Airsoft Shop in Shibuya."
"I read online that it's illegal for minors to
smoke cigarettes."
0
"The theater's closed? Wonder what they're
thinking, closing during summer vacation..."
What's up? Takemi's clinic is right here.
"Guess this is closed, too. Maybe they're taking
a vacation for the summer."
"Hey, that's Takemi's clinic. Maybe we can go
see her later."
"We can visit Takemi later. She's probably
working right now, anyway."
Is this the internal clinic you were talking about?
"Yeah. But there's a notice here... ""Notice:
Closed for the summer."""
"""I will be attending an academic conference
and will be out for the summer."" Signed,
Physician Tae Takemi."
"Oh, man... Talk about bad timing."
"At least we can still get some weapons at Iwai's
Airsoft Shop, right?"
"Is that the shop on Central Street in Shibuya?
I saw it while we were gathering information
on Alice."
"Yeah, that's it all right. Either way, let's head
to Shibuya first, [1B]S1."
"It's a shame that we won't be able to get help
from Takemi, but it sounds like she's working
hard."
"We didn't have time to say hello, either... Well,
it's Takemi. I'm sure she's doing well."

"Why are you heading back to the station?
Everyone's waiting for you!"

"Well, here we are... Doesn't look like
things've changed much."
All right! Let's go!
Okay. Let's gather everyone.

Don't even think about washing me in there...
"They're working even though there's no one
here... They must be hard workers."
"We might have to use machines like this at the
places we visit, huh?"
"Looks like they've got a lot of random stuff,
like always..."
"We're shopping at Shibuya with Ryuji, right?
C'mon, let's hurry."
"They have a lot of stuff... Nothing that'd help us
with the Jail, though."
"Doesn't look like they have anything that'd be
useful on our trip."

"Why are you heading back to the station?
Everyone's waiting for you!"
"Where're you going? Leblanc should be down
the alley back there."
"Hey, we're meeting up at Shibuya, remember?
The station's back there."
"There's nothing for us at the residential district.
Let's hurry to Takemi's place."
"Aren't we going to Shibuya? The station's on the
other side."
"Where're you going? We have no business that
way."
"Did you get turned around? It's in the alley by
the secondhand shop."
"C'mon, that's not the way to the station. Let's
get on a train and cool off already..."
"You're going a little too far. Wasn't Takemi
Clinic back there?"
"If we want to go to Shibuya, don't we have to go
to the station?"
"There's no reason for us to go that way. Let's
head back."
"I get wanting to take a quick bath, but it's only open during the evening, remember?"
"This store looks very old... Is it even open for
business?"
"We should figure out what we're doing about
bathing during the trip..."

"He was waiting for his owner even in heat like
this, huh... Even I can respect him."
"The statue of the loyal dog, Buchiko...
Dogs aren't human, but could they still

important thing is trusting each other."
Hmm... I'll do my best.
"I know it's very hot, but do your best, Buchiko.
I'll do my best, too."
"I bet even Buchiko didn't think there'd be a
problem like this in Shibuya again."
"Hey, Buchiko. We're going on a trip. I know it's
hot, but stay strong."
"More and more people are quitting smoking...
Maybe one day we won't have a need for this
place."
"Look at all the puffy smoke... It must be hard
being crammed into such a small area."

"I hear that Alice's base of operations is here in
Shibuya. Let's gather as much information as we
can."
"Hey, let's leave the lottery for next time."
This is a store too? Was I also in a box like this?
"Are you trying to make money for the trip?
But we won't know the results for a while..."
"Let's go find Ryuji. He should be waiting at the
Buchiko statue."
"We should focus on gathering information.
Why don't you ask around at Station Square
or Central Street?"
"There seem to be a lot of trains coming to this
station."
"Hey. Don't go too far, okay?"
"Where are you going? This is where we're
supposed to meet up."
"You're not going to leave, are you? We're
supposed to gather information on Alice."
"Did you forget something? The Airsoft Shop's at
Central Street."
"I remember when you used that train to get to
school. It was always so packed..."
"Hey. Don't go too far, okay?"
"Anything interesting playing? Not that we have
time to watch a movie right now."
"We don't have time to see a movie. Have you
finished preparing for the trip?"

"What is this place? It looks interesting... So
shiny..."
"This arcade's usually empty. We probably won't
get much information here."
"This arcade's usually empty. Let's gather
information somewhere else."
"You can shoot guns here? I want to try that
sometime..."
"We don't have time to play games right now.
Let's get ready and head back to Yongen."
"Isn't having the lockers this far from the station
kind of inconvenient?"
"I wonder how much it'd cost us to leave our
luggage here for the whole trip..."
"Exercising is a good thing, but we need to focus
on Alice for right now."
Would I look like that if I worked out?
"We don't have time to work out. We'll just have
to get in our exercise through combat."
"We can't really ask around in here... Let's try
somewhere else."
"Do we really have time for karaoke? Iwai's store
is just behind this one."
I want to sing～♪
"When this is done, I want Lady Ann to hear my
amazing singing voice..."
"If you wanna hear me sing, we can do karaoke
in the camper."
"""Temporarily Closed""? That means Iwai's not
here..."
"I figured Iwai would know about Shibuya, but
there's not much we can do if he's not here."
"I figured Iwai would know about Shibuya, but
there's not much we can do if he's not here."
"Hold on. Iwai should be here... but it looks like
they're closed."
"Looks like that ""Temporarily Closed"" sign's been
up for a while, too."
"What should we do? Not getting medicine is
bad enough, but if Iwai's not here we can't get
any weapons either."
"We'll have to figure out something else. Let's
gather the others and brainstorm at Leblanc."
"Maybe he's on vacation with his son? It is
summer vacation, after all."
"I had a feeling they'd be closed. I was hoping to
say hello, but I guess we'll have to wait until next
time."
"Look at all those clothes... They look different
from the ones Alice was wearing."
"Alice's clothing line was very fancy. Do you
think we'll be able to see it again someday?"
"The employees look as busy as ever. I feel
exhausted just watching them."
"We'll have to hold off on eating. I'm sure the
chief's waiting on us."
"I think I've said this before, but you're not really
a crêpe person, are you?"
"It looks very nice, but I'm pretty sure we can't
take it into the Jail."
"It always smells so good at this store. If only I
could take Lady Ann to places like this during
our trip..."
"Look how busy it is... I guess it would be when
it's this hot outside."
"We don't have time to eat here. If you're
hungry, you can eat in the camper."

"Lord Masamune surely wouldn't want someone
doing whatever they please in his domain."
"...I'll do my best to help Date Masamune and the
people of Sendai."
"I bet even Lord Masamune himself would be
surprised by what we did."
"There're so many different types of charms
and talismans... Humans must have so many
different worries and stresses."
"Looks like it's closed. Let's check back during the
day."
Everyone's hanging up gourds. How come?
"It seems the idea is that people expel the evil
from their bodies and into these gourds."
"So they're exorcism charms. People sure do come
up with some interesting ideas sometimes."
"Gourds contain evil. Be sure you don't open one,
[1B]S1."
"This shrine's pretty impressive. What are you
gonna wish for?"
"[1B]S1, wish that I might be able
to help everyone."
Shrines at night have a really neat atmosphere.
"It's almost time. Maybe you should donate some
money?"
"We're finally finishing up. Let's put our plan into
action once we're done!"
Let's pray for the safety of our trip.
Everyone's gone ahead. Let's go to the statue.
"So you're supposed to purify yourself here
before you visit the shrine... Will such a small
amount of water really be enough?"
"It's not so much about quantity. I think it's more
about cleansing your heart."
Hmm... I see. That's very informative.
"It seems like you're supposed to clean in the
order of left hand, right hand, and then your
mouth... You don't drink the water, though."
"I guess you can visit shrines during the night too.
We should go and get ourselves cleansed."
"They seem to have armor and swords related to
Masamune here. Do you want to try them out?"
"The Phantom Thieves saved the people of
Sendai. But I don't think that will be recorded in
this region's data."
"But it's in our memories, right? That's all that
matters."
"...Yes, I've recorded it. I feel that I've learned
something new."
"I feel that I've learned something new. I'm going
to work even harder to be useful from now on."

"It's closed. You should come back during the day
if you want to draw a fortune."
"I'd like to do this too. It'd be fun to take this to
the Jail... but I don't know if that's a good idea."
"I want to take a picture but I think my face is too
small..."
"""I hope Natsume-sensei sells 100 million copies!""
""I want Natsume to feel just how much I love
him."""
"There's some wishes pertaining to Ango
Natsume mixed in with some of the others..."
"""I wish Natsume-sensei's novels will be
remembered for eternity!"" ""I hope Natsume's
future is brighter than a thousand suns!"""
"...It's not bad to wish for someone's happiness.
But it's not the same if they're being forced to
do so."
"...Seeing all the people's wishes on these Ema
makes me think of how people act toward
Madicce's EMMA."
"So people tie their fortunes here in hopes of
connecting with the gods."
"Amulets come in all shapes and colors. They're
also just fun to look at."
"Looks like it's closed. Let's check back during the
day."
"It's supposed to be an unlucky year for the
people whose ages are written here. I wonder
how old I am..."
"Bad things happen to people, regardless of their
age. You'd know a thing or two about that."
"That's the parking lot. The Masamune statue is
just through the narrow road up ahead."
Where are you going? That's the parking lot.
"That's the parking lot for tour buses. There's
nothing for us over there."
"It's the map of the area. It's protected by rivers
and cliffs, just as a castle should be."

"This is an elevator, but it won't take you down to the shopping arcade."
"I didn't know there was a temple here. It's small
but kinda distinguished if you really look at it."
"Apparently, businesses come here for good luck.
Please support my store, the Sophia Shop."
"This place is also for people to make wishes,
right? How interesting."
"Maybe we should pray for a safe trip while we're
here."
"You helped a lot of people, [1B]S1.
Let's keep it up."
"It's a big department store. We shouldn't go in
there unless we have to."
"They were selling a lot of clothing and other
miscellaneous goods in there. The shopping
arcade is better for stocking up on supplies."
"This is where we came for beef tongue. We'll
have to come back one day..."
"There's a bus and taxi terminal down there.
I see lots of cars near the station."
Where would you like to go? You should take the stairs on the other side if you want to go down to the shopping arcade.
Welcome.
...Huh? Ango Natsume? Of course I know him.
"He seems to like our products. A lot of his fans
give them to him as a gift."
"They sell like hotcakes, I tell ya. And it's all
thanks to Natsume. Haha."
"But, just between you and me, I'm honestly
kinda worried about how much money the fans
are spending on all this stuff."
"That's not unlike what was happening with Alice.
She had fans pouring in abnormal amounts of
money, too..."
Care to buy something?
"This is a pretty big station. I guess the city's doing
pretty good for itself."
"It's getting crowded, and late too. We should
head back to the hideout."
"There are a lot of people here. Probably because
of the Tanabata festival..."

"People are allowed to ride the Ferris wheel,
right? I wonder if you can see the tower while
you're on it."
"I grow uneasy each time we pass through this
path. I can't forget the look on the faces of the
people who come here."
"Even I can understand... What happened here
was a tragedy."
"Riding the Ferris wheel? By yourself? Why not
invite someone to join you?"
"That route leads to the station. You want to
take the one that leads to Suzushino."
"Hmm? Is something wrong? I thought we were
going to ride the Ferris wheel."
"Man, this place is probably pretty creepy at
night."
"Hmm, a politician's poster? Are elections
coming up?"
"Look at all the people crowding the poster.
This election must be a big deal to them."
"There are more people around Suzushino at
night. Let's gather intel on Hyodo there."
"They aren't open right now. There seem to be
a great many stores that are only open during
the night."
"Looks like a cleanup campaign's coming
soon... This amount of posters might be
overkill, though."
"Guess this cleanup campaign's Hyodo's way of
getting attention."

"We may as well have a day at the beach if the
staff won't be returning until tomorrow."
"Man, that was a real devious setup they had
going here. It just makes me even more sure
the list we found will lead to the true culprit."
"[1B]S1, let's return to the beach.
Your attire will draw too much attention
elsewhere."
"The police'll take care of everything from this
point. We should get out of here."
"All this attention Hyodo's getting... It's just like
in Shibuya and Sendai. "

"Ooh, check out the fountain. The water sounds
pretty soothing, doesn't it?"
Let's poke around some more after a bath.
"Everyone has already departed for the tower.
We should go as well."
"Why are you here? Suzushino is due south
from the park."
"Apparently taking pictures of the fountain with
the tower in view is a popular activity here."
"Haru should be waiting for us just ahead.
I wonder what she wants."
"The light playing across the water is truly
beautiful. I feel like I could watch this forever."
"This tower has stood here for over fifty
years. That's considerably older than
you are, [1B]S1."
You can reach Suzushino that way.
"You seem to have passed the fountain. Let's
double back and find Haru."
"The tower's like a giant piece of art itself when
it's all lit up. It's pretty astonishing up close."
"We'll have to try and see Sapporo from the top
floor the next time we're here."
"That family seemed rather upset earlier.
Did something bad happen here?"
"Haru doesn't seem pleased after speaking with
Hyodo. I wonder what she wants to discuss."
This place... So sad...
"I wonder... How does Hyodo react to the sight
of these flowers?"
"I hope that girl sees these flowers and knows
how everyone feels—especially Hyodo..."
"Suzushino is the other way—that way will take
you to Sapporo Station and the old government
office."
"Where are you going? Haru's waiting at the
fountain. "
"Everyone already went to the tower—let's
catch up to them before we wind up getting
lost."
"Where are you going? Haru's waiting at the
fountain. "
"This path will lead us out of the area. Let's head
back towards the TV tower."
"This path will lead us the wrong way. We should
take a different route."
It's late. We should hurry to Haru instead.
"Everyone already went to the tower—let's
catch up to them before we wind up getting
lost."
"One moment. If you're going to Suzushino,
you should leave from the other side. "
It's late. We should hurry to Haru instead.
"This path will lead us out of the area. Let's head
back towards the TV tower."
"This path will lead us the wrong way. We should
take a different route."
It's late. We should hurry to Haru instead.
"One moment. If you're going to Suzushino,
you should leave from the other side. "
Did you intend to tour Sapporo on your own?
"I wouldn't recommend it—Makoto will be
rather upset with you. It would be better for
your health if you met up with Haru instead."
It's late. We should hurry to Haru instead.
"Looks like we could grab a meal here—but
I don't know how much I'd enjoy it, in this
heat..."
What are you doing? Haru's right there.
"I bet it'd feel real nice hanging out at a place
like this on a cool summer night..."
"With the facilities inside, this would
actually make a pretty fine hideout."
"We're meeting Haru by the fountain.
We shouldn't keep her waiting."
I sure wouldn't want to be alone here at night...
"Make sure you take care of all your business
before we head out, okay?"
"Now there's a place Lady Ann would love...
Too bad they're only open at night."
"Whoa, check out all the restaurants! They look
and smell so good!"
"I wouldn't even know where to begin looking
for a meal in a place like this..."
"Okay, we're here."
"Ooh, what a fancy spot. Okay, go get yourself
cleaned up."
"Good thing we've got this bathhouse right by
the RV, huh?"
"Kyoto's not very close to this place, is it? I guess
it'll be quite some time before we get to relax
in a bathhouse again... "
"This shopping district has quite the fascinating
history."
"Apparently, fans of the supernatural are very
""into"" this place. I don't really get why, though."
"What's with all the posters? Is this some local
politician?"
"This weird groundswell of support... It reminds
me of Shibuya and Sendai."
"No need to rent one of those—we've already
got a set of wheels."
"Let's head back once we've wrapped up this
problem. We don't know when the guys who
attacked us will show up again."
"I want to ride a bicycle someday. Teach me
how to ride one sometime, [1B]S1."
I can see something up the path here...
"It appears to be a large concrete wall, likely
several inches thick. There is too much brush
in the way to see any clearer than this, though."
"Sounds like it might be worth checking
out. Should we call everyone over here,
[1B]S1?"
"The police'll take care of everything from this
point. We should get out of here."
"With all the effort they went into keeping this
place's secret, now I'm extra curious what it
could be."
"Please avoid straying too far from the port.
We need to ask passersby about information
regarding the research facility."
"The beach is crawling with locals looking for us.
We shouldn't go back there now."
"They look so pompous until you get up close,
then they actually look pretty friendly."
"Shiisaa are guardian deities that reportedly
repel evil spirits. We should pray for them
to protect us."
"It is time for us to depart. Please keep the island
safe in our absence, Shiisaa."
"I'm so lucky to experience yet another brand
new sight. I think... this is what happiness feels
like."
"Well, there's the proof we have nowhere
that we can run. Our only option is to fix
our situation via the Jail."
"The weather's nice and clear today. I bet we're
in for smooth sailing."
"The locals' domiciles are just beyond this point.
We should not poke around there without good
reason or we could upset them."
"Wait! There are some locals over there. Let's
head back to the lab."
"Hey, don't go too far—the boat's departing soon."
"It's getting late. Will anyone come to put these
away?"
"This beach trip sure felt different from the last
one, considering we almost had this whole
place to ourselves."
"Hey, [1B]S1, I've found a rather
curious location."
"I'm sure everyone is having a blast right now,
but it's still a good time to summon them all."
"Everyone has at least one place that they
hold dear to their heart... I wonder what
mine would be?"
It appears they are closed for the evening.
"Hang around here for too long and you may
discover you've rented an innertube and gone
for a swim without even realizing it!"
......
"So, [1B]S1, this is one of those places
that's going to stay in your heart, right?
I can tell."
"I know these aren't the right words, but it's
almost as if I have a sense of contentment
within my own chest, too."
"I don't wanna leave this place either, but if you
hang around long enough, we really will be
stuck here, and we have too much to do for that."
"So humans come to this place when they want to
laugh? It must be a happy place, then."
"I wonder if somebody will use all this
commotion as part of their comedy routine."
"I'm always happy when I see the Phantom
Thieves smiling. I hope I'll be able to make
everyone else smile too."
"There are lots of takoyaki shops in Shinsekai too.
Why don't we go buy some?"
"If you want to buy some takoyaki for our next
Jail visit, I believe there was a closer shop in
Shinsekai."
"Gotta be tough to work that takoyaki pan all day
in this heat."
"This beef bowl chain's gotta be in every city in
Japan. And this one looks really busy, too..."
"The workers here are busy as always. Guess they
don't have time to worry about the phantom
thieves..."
"If you're gonna have one last meal before we
head out, you should get something you can
only eat around here."
"*gasp* Sushi! Hey [1B]S1, we should
stock up on ""supplies"" while we're here!"
"I wouldn't recommend that, Meowgana.
Carrying around raw food in midsummer heat is
a bad idea."
"Nngh... Guess a phantom thief wouldn't look
all that cool with an upset stomach."
"If I do a good job, would you mind treating me
to a meal here, [1B]S1?"
"Mewhehe... Just looking at it's enough to make
me wanna take on all those Shadows myself."
"I guess I'll save the serious eating for when we
get back to Tokyo. The trip's not over until we
get home, right?"
"...I bet you could get a pretty big boost of
stamina here, but I'm not really willing to deal
with the bad breath that's sure to follow."
"It looks way too crowded in there. You might
want to go somewhere else if you wanna eat
something."
"Ramen and gyoza are supposed to be an
""unbeatable combo,"" right? I heard that from
Ryuji."
"...So you grab prizes using the claw inside the
machine? It looks so flimsy, though. Does it
really work?"
"You can play games any day. Now's not the best
time for that."
"If you want a souvenir, wouldn't it be faster to
just buy one?"
"This is the famous Dotonbori River. I'm told
over-enthusiastic sports fans are known to jump
into the water when their team performs well."
"Man, it was really neat seeing the airship fly over
this place!"
"Osaka was a very fun and lively place. Thanks a
bundle, Osaka, and goodbye."
"There's nothing over that way, but there are
plenty of shops in the other direction."
"Don't go too far. Tonight's the night when we
settle everything."
"Hey, don't stray too far. You don't wanna get left
behind now."
"There's nothing down that road. Stay here, or
you might get lost."
"If you need to prepare, you should do that either
here or in Shinsekai."
"If you're gonna do one last round of Osaka, you
should probably stick to the busier streets."
"Tenboto isn't that way. You'll need to backtrack
and head towards Shinsekai."
"Where are you going? We have to go to the
hideout if we want to infiltrate the Jail."
"How far are you going? You should head back to
the car once you're finished preparing."
...I think this is far enough. We can explore more on a different trip.
"Oh yeah, there was a zoo over that way. We
should focus our efforts on the Jail for now,
though."
"I don't think there are any shops over here that'll
help with our infiltration. Let's try somewhere
else."
"We're almost to Tenboto. Come on, let's get
going."
"I don't see much over that way. If you wanna
shop, you should stick to the main road."
"Don't wander around too much. We need to
hurry and finish our business with Konoe."
"I know it's kinda sad, but it's about time to leave
this place. You'll have to wait until next time if
you wanna stroll around."
0
"Looks like everyone else is wandering around
the city. Let's find someone and invite them to
Tenboto."
"We're going to Tenboto, aren't we? You can
check out the comedy acts next time."
"Instead of eating something, perhaps we should
invite someone to join us at Tenboto."
"You wanna go by yourself? Come on, you should
invite someone along."
"Don't you remember what Lady Ann said? We
should avoid eating right now."
"It's hard to turn down sushi... But I'll be strong
and wait for the celebration."
"We don't have any time to eat if we wanna go to
Tenboto."
"Hey, don't just go to sleep, [1B]S1!
Hurry up and show me Sophia!"
"I'm glad to see that this guy's doing well. Looks
like they've been taking good care of it."
"There's a plant in your room. Shouldn't it be
outside?"
"Ooh, are you gonna make some infiltration
tools?"
"...Heh. Brings back memories, doesn't it? Do
you still remember the tricks I taught you?"
"This is where you made them... One of these
days, I'll teach you some more of what I know."
"Is this where the two of you live? What an odd
place..."
"Looks like it's been kept clean. We'd better
remember to thank the chief."
"Make sure to let Futaba check out Sophia when
you get a chance."
"I remember you training with that... If you're
feeling rusty, it might jog your memory."
"Is this where the two of you live? What an odd
place..."
"The shelf's still here, too."
"I'm looking forward to seeing it decorated
with all your summer memories."
"I bet we'll barely have any space left by the end
of the trip. I can't wait!"
"Make sure to let Futaba check out Sophia when
you get a chance."
"I bet you're tired from being on all those busy
streets. Why don't we rest up for tomorrow?"

"The view from here sure brings back
memories..."
"Are you done thinking over what happened
today? I think Futaba's waiting on you."

"Hey, make sure you're prepared before we start
the infiltration. Gather everyone once you're
ready."
All right! Let's gather at the hideout!
"We only just got here, but I guess we won't have
time to visit our old haunts for a while."
I think I'm okay right now.
"Make sure you go before we get in the camper,
all right?"
"Looks like it's empty as always... It makes me
kind of worried."
......
"Hey. Why's that cat's meow sound so anxious?
Everything's fine."
"How long are you gonna stand there for? Your
friends're waiting for you."
Is this store even open for business?
"Hey, who said that?"
Noted. This store is a very slow location.
"We don't have time to relax and have a cup of
coffee anymore."
"We should definitely have a party here once
our trip is over!"
"It's going to be another sunny day for Japan.
The temperature's way up there, too."
"It'll be especially hot in the central city areas,
so take caution and watch out for signs of
heatstroke."
"Looks like it's gonna be hot out again today.
We'd better hurry and go before Ryuji melts."
"Looks like it's gonna be hot out again today.
We'd better hurry and go before Ryuji melts."
"...and with the mayor's term expiring soon,
public attention on the elections are rising."
"The city councilmen's sudden confessions of
their misdeeds may greatly affect the elections."
"I really hope we don't end up in the headlines
or on TV again..."
"I really hope we don't end up in the headlines
or on TV again..."
"Following the scandal surrounding the previous
director, the police agency have announced a
new director."
"According to the press, they would like to put an
end to the confusion caused by the investigation
agency since last year. And..."
"Looks like the police have their own issues...
Do they really have the freedom to be chasing
us right now?"
"Looks like the police have their own issues...
Do they really have the freedom to be chasing
us right now?"
"...stated that they would like to assist in the
creation of a world of AI."
"They have also stated that they would like to put
their capital investment towards this as well."
"AI, huh... Hard to believe that's a normal thing
nowadays."
"I guess it makes sense though. Anyone would
want to use something that convenient."
"Uh... If you haven't noticed yet, the store's open.
Stop getting in the way, will ya?"
"Isn't the food in there? The chief'd be pretty
upset if you touch it without telling him."
"You want coffee right now? Just drink some
when you get home."
"So this is what you use to brew coffee... Show
me how it works next time, okay?"
"I hope we can find good coffee wherever we're
going..."
Who're you gonna call? Let's get going already.
So this is what a phone looks like. It sure is big.
"You wanna see if Kawakami'll help us out with
the store? ...Heh, yeah right."
"It's a masterpiece no matter how you look at it...
You can really feel a mother's love and strength."
"A picture of a woman and a baby. Are they
mother and child?"
"Let's ask Yusuke's mom for her blessing to give
us a safe trip."

"Why don't you use this spot when you have
homework to do?"
There's no one here... It sure is quiet.
"Doesn't look like anyone's here either...
It really is a quiet place."
"The city heat's pretty bad. Don't forget to drink
plenty of water, all right?"
"You all come in so suddenly, then leave in such
a rush... What're you guys getting up to?"
"I've got no idea what you're doing, but... Just
be careful, all right?"
"This looks like fun... But I'd rather see Tenboto
right now."
"The top of this building is an observation deck.
We'll probably be able to see Mt. Aoba."
"I bet the view's gorgeous from up there... But I
guess now's not the time."
"Are you from out of town? You can make a wish
on a tanzaku over here if you like!"
"Hey, [1B]S1..."
"Can you wish so that things will work out
between me and Lady Ann!?"
Write your wish on a tanzaku!
"So everyone writes their wish on that piece of
paper. It must be hard for the person who's
asked to make the wishes come true."
"Finally ""Tanabata""! Make a wish on a tanzaku,
right over here!"
"Maybe now those whose Desires were stolen can
finally make wishes of their own."
"I'm glad we made it to Tanabata. Good job,
Phantom Thieves."

"A store that rents media? That seems like a lot of
work just to borrow information..."
"There's no point in renting something when
we'd never be able to return it in time... We'd
be up to our ears in rental fees."
"Bookstores in the city have so much more
variety. It's a shame we don't have time to read
right now."
"You want to get something to read in the
camper? Won't that make you carsick?"

"Man, I bet business is slow when it's this hot out."
"Looks like there isn’t anything here about the
rumors surrounding Alice. We'll just have to
ask around."
"A kiosk that sells information printed on paper?
That seems inefficient... Wouldn't it just take up
space?"
"Alice made such a big show of apologizing...
I bet it's all over the news now."
"There aren't a lot of people past here. We'll
have better luck gathering information if we
head back."
"Where're you going? You just passed Iwai's
store."
Why are you going that way? All the stores are on Central Street.
"There's nothing over there, remember? Let's go
back before the heat gets unbearable."
0
"The Sendai specialty, sasa-kamaboko. The meat looks so real. Mmm..."
This deck's huge... Look how far it stretches.
"Mt. Aoba Park's in that direction. It's a bit too far
of a walk, however."
"The government office and the rest of the office
district is down that way. Turn back and head
down across the way for the shopping arcade."
"There's nothing over here. Let's not move too far
away."
"It's dangerous to cross. Let's go through the deck
if you want to go back."
"You're going to go away from the center if you
keep going. You should go back if you want to
gather info."
Don't wander too far on your own. You'll get lost.
"It's the same as the one that was on the statue.
Seems like they're everywhere in the city..."
It's up to us to reveal his true colors.
"I bet Natsume's starting to worry, now that we're
so close to his castle."
"Apparently, it's possible to take a boat tour
through this river. I'll bet it's fun to take in the
sights from down below."
"There's nothing over that way. Let's invite
someone to come see Tenboto with us."
"None of us are over there. Shouldn't they be on
the main road?"
"Where are you going? Let's head out and invite
someone to Tenboto."
0
"C'mon, let's get going. We're going to the
camper to discuss plans, remember?"
0
"Please, this way."
Are you going to buy a drink?
0
Are you gonna get something to drink?
"We don't really have much time, but we gotta
stay hydrated... What're you gonna get?"
"Do you wanna buy a fortune and see if we're in
any luck? Says it's 100 yen per draw."
Let's go for it.
Not right now.
"I reached in, hoping for the best."
"Whoa nice! You got ""Great Blessing""! Maybe
something good'll happen!"
"Oh! You got ""Blessing."" That's not bad."
"Hmm... ""Curse"". Well, don't let it get to you,
[1B]S1."
Looks like these fortunes are 100 yen each.
"Doesn't look like you have enough... Let's come
back when you do."
0
"Hey, [1B]S1. What do you say we
look for a four-leaf clover?"
"I hear it brings luck to those who find it, and I
want good things to happen to each of you."
Let's do it.
Maybe later.
It's a four-leaf clover!
"I'm glad you managed to find one. I sure hope
something good happens..."
I couldn't find any...
"Nothing, huh?"
"But maybe that's why it's worth looking—
because it's so rare. Anyway, thanks for
trying."
"Okay, later it is."
0
"Up ahead is the area that's sacred to the island's
people, right?"
"Should we offer a prayer? It might bring us
good fortune."
Sounds good.
Maybe not.
I prayed for safety on our trip together...
I feel a mysterious energy rising up within me...!
I stayed and enjoyed the feeling for a while...
0
"Hm? There's something buried here. Try
brushing the sand off of it."
"Hey, [1B]S1. I saw something
buried in the sand."
"Oh? There's something buried in the sand.
Can you try digging a bit?"
"Ooh, it's a capsule machine. It says...
""Every prize is a surprise!"""
It's 500 yen per try. Wanna test your luck?
I'll give it a try.
Not right now.
"Whoa, super duper ultra mega rare!? That's a
lot of adjectives..."
"Oho, that one's super rare! Lucky you, eh
[1B]S1?"
It says this one's a rare prize. Not too shabby.
"Just a normal prize, huh? Hey, don't look so
down."
"Looks like it's 500 yen per try... You don't have
enough money right now, though. Maybe we
can come back later?"

"They say rubbing Billiken-san's feet will bring
one happiness."
"Care to try it, [1B]S1?"
"Oh, why not?"
No thanks.
"I earnestly rub the Billiken
statue's feet..."
Huh!? My chest feels warm for some reason...
"Maybe I'm becoming happy because
Billiken-san is smiling."
"Apparently, he likes having his feet rubbed
because he can't reach them on his own."
Hmm... Did anything change?
"Well, I'm sure he gets his feet rubbed all the time, so he probably just didn't notice."
"Sorry, Billiken-san. We'll come back later."
"Anyway, that's the rarest possible prize!
Great job!"
"I saw similar singing shops like this in Shibuya.
People sure do love to sing."
What is it that makes people want to sing?
"Hm, guess it makes sense they're not all that
busy this early in the day."
"Whoa, look how busy it is in there! And they're
all having a good time, looks like..."
"Looks like a liquor store. We don't have any
business going in there."
"This place is pretty busy. Lots of tourists, from
the looks of it."
"I could be mistaken, but everyone in there
seems very happy."
"Boy, I hope we can throw our own celebration
real soon!"
"There are an awful lot of smartphone
models available nowadays—yours is a
rather comfortable one, [1B]S1."
"It looks rather busy in there. Luckily, you have
me instead."
"Wow, look at all the people. I wonder why
everyone has such serious expressions..."
"Why don't these people simply look up what
they need online instead of waiting in this line? "
"They must have information that's unavailable
online. I am very curious as to what they know."
"I've got it! It seems there are many things we'll
never know until we see them for ourselves.
I learned something new."
Closed... Looks like they're only open at night.
"Apparently, that billboard is the symbol of
Suzushino. "
"Boy, does that beardo stand out or what? He's
almost as stylish as me!"
"I don't think I could ever grow tired of
watching these lights."
"I've memorized the face on that billboard.
Until next time, bud..."
Looks like that way's just a dead end.
We can't go any further. We should head back.
"The stores up ahead aren't for minors. I don't
think you'd be interested, [1B]S1."
...Hmm?
Why do you seem sad?
"Looks like that's a hotspot for adults. Let's get
out of here before a cop sees us and starts
lecturing you."
"That is a casual bar with a full menu.
It's probably not a great date spot."
"...Where do you keep getting all this stuff,
Sophia?"
"It's quite busy—you can hear the chatter from
all the way out here."
"I could be mistaken, but everyone in there
seems very happy."
"Boy, I hope we can throw our own celebration
real soon!"
"It does really feel like something good
will happen. Billiken-san is incredible."
"I can confirm this is our safest entry point
for Jail access."
"All right, with that settled, we can finally
infiltrate Konoe's Jail."
"If you're gonna infiltrate the Jail, you should go
to the hideout and call everyone over first."
"I know you're eager to get started, so let's gather
everyone at the hideout once we're ready."
"The view from the sky in Konoe's Jail was so
exciting. I hope we get a chance to see the world
from up high again sometime."
"So this ""Downcast Stone"" was dropped, and
therefore wasn't used to build Osaka Castle. It
must be sad being left behind... Nah, no way."
"They say it's ""downcast,"" but would a stone
really feel that way?"
"I like to think this stone ended up here just so it
could meet us. Don't give up, stone."
"So when humans see a hole in cardboard, they like to stick their faces in it. I'm learning all sorts of things on this trip."
"This isn't the time to be taking pictures. You can
do that once we've settled everything."
"If we were to take a picture here... I would want
to be the takoyaki. As our leader, you would be
in the middle, [1B]S1."
"Oh, a blowfish restaurant...?"
"Online superstition states blowfish poison
doesn't affect cats. But just to be safe, make sure
not to steal any from the fishermen, Meowgana."
"I'm not gonna steal any! And stop calling me
Meowgana!"
"Still, blowfish in Osaka is cheap and tastes great.
It'd be a real treat if we got to eat our fill."
"It's the last week of summer vacation. All the
shops are getting tons of business."
"Humans are so tough. They'll eat anything as
long as it tastes good, poisonous or otherwise."
"People catch the fish, and then the customers
catch them again to eat them? Humans do
some truly interesting things..."
"The places around here sure are packed this time
of year. Let's keep our spirits up too!"
"Could you catch a big one for me? I would try
myself, but I can't fish."
"If you're interested in fishing, we know a good
spot in Tokyo! Don't we, [1B]S1."
"This building looks a little strange. It doesn't
seem like they're open, though."
...It's closed. What kind of shop is this?
"Would Leblanc get more customers if it stood
out like this?"
"It's an old-timey café. But the atmosphere's
pretty different from the chief's shop."
"It's a full house, even at night. It's quite different
from Sojiro's quiet little shop."
"I get that you wanna relax and enjoy the air
for a bit, but we should save it for another time."
"There's a zoo of some sort over that way, but it's
not an ideal place to infiltrate the Jail."
"It's so busy at night. Just what I'd expect from the
biggest city in the Kansai region."
"Right, there was a zoo over that way. I hope I get
to see a real one someday."
"That's the long way around. Tenboto's north of
here."
What are you doing? Aren't you going to shop?
"People are coming through nonstop. This area
must be popular."
"Doesn't look like there's many shops if you stray
from the main road."
What's up? There aren't any shops this way.
"It's fun to imagine what could be further down
these roads."
"There are lots of hotels and apartments lined up
here. I don't think we have any business at them,
though."
"It looks like everyone is starting to go home.
Meanwhile, we're just now getting to work."
"I can see some hotels and bathhouses, but
nothing of interest to us right now."
"I don't see much down this way... We should
make our way over to the tower."
"Don't go too far on your own. If you want to
resupply, the shops around here should suffice."
"Tonight's when we settle things once and for all.
We don't have time to wander around."
"Next time we come here, I bet it'd be fun to
explore these side streets."
"There are no shops that way. Let's turn back and
head to the tower."
"Nothing here but parking lots and stuff. Let's
head back to the main road."
"Don't wander off. We gotta focus on getting
ready."
"...We're leaving soon, aren't we? We shouldn't
go any further."
"You went too far, [1B]S1. The
infiltration point is right below Tenboto."
"That way leads to the main thoroughfare and the
station. We don't need to go there."
All ready to go? I don't see any shops over there.
"That way leads to the main thoroughfare and the
station. We should head back to where everyone
else is."
"He looks satisfied, so I'm sure he'll send some
happiness your way."
"Okay. Next time, then."

"I'm glad everyone got to enjoy this last night
together."
"I'm going to remember this for a long time...
Especially how beautiful Lady Ann looked
under the fireworks' lights!"
"I know we've been together for a long time and
all, but..."
"I just keep remembering how it's thanks to
you, and everyone else that... that I'm even
here like this, at all."
"I hope we stick together for a good, long time,
[1B]S1."
Right back 'atcha.
Just don't be too much of a pain.
Where's all this coming from?
I can't wait to see what we'll get up to next!
"Nyahaha, look who's talking! Like you'd ever
survive if I went easy on you!"
"Eh, who knows? Maybe it's the trip winding
down and the great time we had tonight
making me a tad sentimental."
"All right... I don't want to make a big deal out
of it or anything, but this is for you."
"It's a bright,
luxurious scarf..."
"I wanted to give you something to, you know,
commemorate the trip. Sophia helped me with
the picking out and the ordering. "
"It's a scarf in the Phantom Thieves' signature
color. You should wear it if the Thieves ever
take on another case."
Thank you.
I'll take good care of it.
"Hopefully, there'll be no need."
"Nyeheheh, now I'm getting embarrassed."
"Nyeheheh, now I'm getting embarrassed."
"Well, you never know what you might find
yourself getting into—after all, you're pretty
special!"
Also... these are from Sophia.
"They're a pair of fine
embroidered gloves..."
"She wanted to thank you too, so I helped her
pick a gift."
"I wanted them made specially for you to best
express my gratitude. They should complement
the scarf nicely."
What great keepsakes.
I'll cherish them.
"Looks like he's a fan! Great job, Sophia."
"Although, I also played a vital part as the
[1B]S1 expert!"
"[1B]S1 and Meowgana truly make
an outstanding duo."
"Yep, we've gotten close enough that— Hey!
WHAT'D you call me!?"
"I'm sorry, Morgana. My intention was to
compliment you."
"At least you're not calling me a raccoon
anymore..."
"I'm sorry for that as well, Morgana. Thanks for
everything you've done despite such offense."

"I'm glad everyone got to enjoy this last night

"You must truly love Ann, Morgana."
"Uhhhh, well it's not that, it's more that when
I see her smile, and... her smiling... and... and..."
"And that was why we went looking for sweets
in Sendai. Ann was clearly pleased with the
results."
"Yeah, her smile really is my own Treasure."
"I know we've been together for a long time and
all, but..."
"I just keep remembering how it's thanks to
you, and everyone else that... that I'm even
here like this, at all."
"I hope we stick together for a good, long time,

"Yooo, headed to meet up with Ryuji? Good
luck with the shopping!"
"I knew I'd be more help doin' it all online, so
I'm researching campsites now. I'll make sure
we pick the best one!"
"Playing in the river and eating barbecue all day,
lighting fireworks and telling scary stories all
night..."
"This is gonna be so much fun! I can't wait
another second, I'm so excited I'm gonna
explode! Hit the deck, [1B]S1!"
"Uuuugh, I'm overheating here! I bet Ryuji's
not holding up any better out in front of the
Buchiko statue, either..."
"I knew people went crazy for her stuff, but...
this is something else."
"I keep hearing stories about relationships going
south—even folks ending up hospitalized for
exhaustion—and Alice's name always comes up."
"Could she really have something to do with
all of it? But, how? And why?"
"...I guess there's no point getting stressed over
it now. Oh, I know! Are you hungry?"
"No good ideas on an empty stomach, ya know!
I'm gonna grab a crêpe and start the brainstorm!"
"I already know which kind I want—extra
chocolate and extra whipped cream. Ooh,
and maybe I'll have 'em add strawberries!"
That's a bit much...
Just hearing that burst my belt.
"Well... It's fine! I'm just gonna work out extra
later!"
"Really? Then there's no reason not to go all-out
at this point! Let's throw a triple scoop of vanilla
and the full mixed berry toppings on there!"
"Once I've had my brain food, I'll get back to
gathering intel and putting it all together. Stay
hydrated, okay, [1B]S1? It's a hot one."
"Alice is more popular than I had imagined.
I wouldn't be able to avoid hearing people
speak of her even if I wanted to. "
"So, ""Alice in Wonderland""? I admit, it's an
intriguing and visually striking space to work
within, as an artist..."
"So, ""Dragon: Like a Yakuza"" is finally out?
*sigh* I can't just go by myself though..."
Should I grab a couple tickets?
Thinking about playing hooky?
"Eek! How long have you been there!? N-No
need—the poster just caught my eye, is all..."
"Eek! How long have you been there!? I-It's
nothing like that—the poster just caught my
eye, is all..."
"Anyway, I heard quite a few employees at this
theater were let go all of a sudden..."
"And the rumor is, it's all because they ""weren't
fans of Alice."" What's that about?"
"No one gets fired for such an absurd reason
without something going on behind the
scenes."
"I'm going to ask around a little more about it.
Let me know when you're calling it a day and
we can regroup."
"I peeked into a store in 705 a few moments ago
and all the customers had that invitation card..."
"Her number of ""friends"" is probably increasing
as we speak."
"Not only that—out of all of the people I saw
going into stores that carry her products?"
"Most of them were dead-eyed men, and
every single one of them left with armfuls
of merchandise."
"Consistent binge-purchasing like that can't be
an everyday occurrence."
"Hrrrrgh... Too many people... Can't do iiiiit...
Wanna go hoooome..."
"Yikes, are you okay, Futaba? I thought you said
school had gotten you used to crowds."
"I underestimated the Summer Vacation Edition
of Shibuya... The swarm of partiers is just too
much for me."
"And even ignoring that, going up to people
I don't know and eavesdropping on them or
pumping them for intel is way outta my league."
Don't stress yourself over it.
I'll take care of it.
"He's right, leave this to us. You've got the
online front locked down, Futaba."
"He's right, leave this to us. You've got the
online front locked down, Futaba."
"I can lend you a hand, Futaba. We can both
""lock down"" the ""online front."""
"Ooh, thanks, Sophia! Time to join forces as a
cyber-sleuth tag team!"
Okay. I'll help however you'd like.
"Nice recruiting, Futaba! We're counting on
you two."
"Thanks for talkin' to me, guys... I'm feeling a
little more comfortable out here now."
"Oh, hey! Why don'tcha take this,
[1B]S1? For helping me out!"
May it aid you on your quest for intel!
"Okay, Sophia, send me all the data you can find
on any aberrational behavior reported in the
area recently—start with the last two weeks."
"Got it. I'll send them your way in just a moment.
Best of luck with the analysis, Futaba."

"Damn that fishy old man... I swear, you'll never
catch me trustin' a cop."
"Knight in shinin' armor, my ass! Grrr, the more
I remember about him, the more pissed I get!"
"Whenever you feel that happening to you,
drink some milk."
Huh? Uhhhh... Why?
"The tryptophan found in milk releases
melatonin in your brain like WHOOSHHH
and then you start to feel all AHHHHHHH."
"Right, uh... I'll go chug one now."
"I guess there's no point gettin' pissed now.
We just gotta take Alice down and prove
we're innocent! "
"I'm startin' to get used to this Jail shit. Let's rock
this next mission, too!"
0
"No prob—there are many businesses in the area
relevant to our needs."
Good point. We'd better brace ourselves...
"Here, use this if you'd like. We're counting on
you."
We're counting on you.
"Great! Let's take in the sights and pick up
what we need on our way to Shinsekai!"
"Oh that reminds me—I bought this at the
pharmacy earlier. Apparently, it's grown
popular for being so effective."
"This was the last one they had, too. Hopefully
it'll be of use to you."
"I'm sure we'll be all right so long as we work
together. Let's give it our best!"
"Please, come this way. I must discuss a certain
matter with you. "

"At first I figured he might be one of 'em from
the wacked-out look in his eyes, and yep—ain't
no mistakin' that kinda crazy."
"That dude in front of Buchiko was actin'
pretty much the same, right? No way
that's a coincidence."

"Was that customer just rambling about the
Phantom Thieves? Something about a calling
card?"
"Ah, don't worry about it."
I'm sorry...
"*sigh* So in other words, you're about to do
something crazy."
"*sigh* So in other words, you're about to do
something crazy."
"Well, make sure it's not stupid too—although,
I guess I don't have to worry about that with
you."
"Just... look after Futaba for me, all right?"
"Dude, aren't you psyched? We get to ride in an
actual friggin' RV this summer!"
"I have a feeling life is going to get a lot rougher
for Alice, in a bunch of ways..."
"But I know there are people out there who
have looked up to her, well before she started
all this and lost her way."
"Those people are gonna be so pumped when
she makes her comeback! That's why I hope
she doesn't just give up on her dreams."
You're so kind.
Sounds pretty tough...
"You keep at it too, Ann."
"I mean... I told her how I really feel about her,
so I definitely have to cheer her on!"
"Mmhm, but I have to have faith that she can
do it!"
"Yeah, I've really gotta up my game, too."
"Oh, sorry! I didn't mean to get all sappy right
before we leave and everything."
"I'm really pumped to get to take this trip with
everyone. We'd better make the most of it,
right?"
"Ta-daaaah! I brought a whole bunch of games—
let's play some when we all have the time for it!"
"What should we play to kick things off?
The Game of Strife... JUNO... *gasp* Ooh!
What about Jonga? While we're moving!?"
"Driving something as big as an RV is a first for
me—I admit I'm at least a bit nervous..."
"But I'm still looking forward to it. I've wanted to
go on a long road trip for some time now."
"...Don't worry, I won't gun it like with Johanna."
"We may have to focus our efforts on the case,
but I'm still excited for our trip."
"I'm extra glad I asked for some time off at the
company now that all this has come together."
*giggle* I hope we all have a great time!
"Listen, Inari—you only get 500 yen for snacks
for now, okay?"
"Wha—!? B-But rock salt's not a snack, yes!?"
"Isn't this supposed to be a long excursion,
though? I'd better stock up as best I can..."

"Ooh! You all set? Then I oughta
start getting ready too!"
"Our mission begins... tomorrow
night! "
Right! Let's do this!
"...Understood. I will entrust
Zenkichi with this calling card. "
"Regardless of what drove Natsume
down this path... he has been gripped
by vanity. Turned to evil."
Yeah! I'm ready any time!
"Haru... I take it we can leave this
card's contents to you?"
"We must prepare a suitable calling
card. Have you thought of what
to write, Zenkichi?"
"...That's what I'm trying to figure
out right now."
"Man, don't blame me if this sounds
weird... Just remember, you asked
for this, okay?"
"If he cannot see the distortion in his
heart... then we will lay it bare!"
"Yes. I want to show Mari-san how
I feel personally. You ought to rest—
I'll get to writing."
"Tomorrow's the big day... Let's
give it our all, guys!"
......
"After all that crap he put Akane
through, we gotta make this count.
Put him on blast!"
"Delivering the calling card is just
the beginning. We're counting on you
to help us finish the job, Zenkichi."
"Yeah, I'll bet... You guys are real
slave drivers, you know that?"
