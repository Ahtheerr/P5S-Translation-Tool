We can get inside from here.
"Once we get in the castle, we're headed
straight for the roof."
Are you ready?
Let's go.
We should prepare first.
"All right, let's go!"
Let's come back here once we're prepared.

Time to start hacking! Y'guys ready?
Definitely.
We still need to get ready...
"All right, hacking in! Make sure you back me up!"
Got it. Prepping's important.

"Hey, where are you going? We should be
focusing on the operation."
"Hey, where are you going? We should be
focusing on the operation."
We're unable to proceed. It may be due to the blizzard.
"Hm, we're unable to proceed. Reason:
unknown. Let's continue investigating."
"Hm, we're unable to proceed. Reason:
unknown. Let's continue investigating."
We're unable to proceed right now. It may be best to figure out the reason first.
"Looks like we can't go to other checkpoints
right now. Let's press on."
"Looks like we can't go there right now.
Let's keep moving."
We can't go anywhere right now.
"Uh, I don't think you have enough ingredients."
We should make some curry.

Hey! What are you doing!?
An intruder!
I won't let you pass!
Wh-Who's there!
Stop right there!
You're not going anywhere!
Who the hell are you!?
How did you get in!?
Stay right there!
The hell did you come from!
I'll get you!
No one gets through me!
What're you doing in here!?
Damn it! Someone stop them!
You won't escape!
Found you!
Sneaky bastards!
Don't move!
Intruder located!
Wh-What the—!?
How did you make it this far!
Get them out of here!
Y-You!
Don't get cocky!
There they are!
Those filthy thieves...
This is where you die!
"Hey, who are you!?"
What happened to the guards!?
Go! Eliminate them!

Hang on a sec! Stop!
"I'm getting a super powerful reading! We'll be
in deep trouble if we charge in there without
being ready for it."
"Are you talking about the Shadow over there
throwing off sparks?"
That thing could really mess us up...
"There's no knowing what it can do. If you're
gonna tussle with it, make sure you're prepped."
"It might even be a wise idea to not pick a fight
with it right now."
We can pursue it once we've gotten stronger.

"I'm getting another one of those scary
readings. I really don't recommend
going over there."
"You mean that scary-ass Shadow we found
before? There's another one...?"
"What's your call, Joker? We don't know what
we might be getting into."
"If you're not confident that we can beat it, you
may wanna hold off that fight for now."

Fuse two Personas to gain a new one.
Please select the Persona to acquire.
You've tapped into a new power.
"Whenever you feel the need for more,
come visit me at any time."
"I will always be by your side. Until next time,
farewell..."
"Unless you acquire new powers, the journey
that awaits you will become an impossible one."
You should first fuse a new Persona.

Are we heading out?
Let's go.
I need a moment.
"All right, let's do this!"
Let's get going once you're ready.
Are we heading out?
Let's go.
I need a moment.
"Okay, we're off to Okinawa!"
We should get going once we're ready.
Are you sure we're okay to take off?
Let's go.
I need a moment.
"All right, next up is Kyushu. Let's do this!"
Got it. Let me know when you're ready.
Are we moving out?
Let's go.
Not yet.
"Roger that. It's time we put a stop to EMMA's
server for good."
"Fine, just let me know when you're ready."
"Once we head to the Tokyo Radio Tower, we
may not be able to return here anymore."
Should we head out?
Let's go.
I need a moment.
......
Okay. Time to go to the Tokyo Radio Tower!
"Okay. Who knows what we'll find—we should
prepare ourselves to the fullest."
Ready? Hurry up and take a seat.

"The power of the masks you have obtained
will be vital to this strengthening process.
Let us try it now."
Please start by selecting a Persona.
"What say we try strengthening a Persona
before you depart?"
"All Personas you have previously registered
can be summoned—for a fee."
"You can strengthen the Personas you have already
acquired as well."
"There, your Persona has grown. This process
can be repeated to draw out further powers."
"One way to consider a Persona is that it is
the ""other self""—their growth is your own
growth as well."
"Please make wise use of this strengthening
henceforth."

Definitely.
Let me just make sure...

"Do you desire this Persona? Then in turn,
I request [1B]S3 yen."
I'm sure.
Never mind.
"You are about to use Personas as materials
that are higher in level than those currently
registered."
"Would you like to register these Personas in
their current states prior to fusion?"
Please do.
No thanks.
"From the power it has accumulated,
it will be able to obtain even more
strength."
I'm sure.
No thanks.

I made a request—could you take a peek at it?
"The Jail can wait—I need you to check out my
request first."

"It seems some of your Personas are a lower
level than those you have already registered."
"Shall I register only the Personas that are
higher in level?"
"Yes, just the higher-level ones."
"Register all of them, actually."

"Do you desire this Persona? Then in turn,
