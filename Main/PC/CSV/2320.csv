first?",0,113,1,-1,6812,0
"Don't do it, Akane!",1,21,2,-1,6813,0
Whoa! GRAMPS!?,2,1,4,-1,6814,0
He escaped the police after all!,3,3,4,-1,6815,0
What are you doing here...?,4,113,0,-1,6816,0
Guys! We came to help!,5,7,2,-1,6817,0
Oracle! I can hardly believe it!,6,6,1,-1,6818,0
"Good going, Oracle. I knew you'd come.",7,10,1,-1,6819,0
"You are Akane, right?",8,21,5,-1,6820,0
......,9,113,0,-1,6821,0
"Just stop this. None of them did anything wrong.
If you're willing, we can talk this out.",10,21,3,-1,6822,0
Talk it out? With you?,11,113,0,-1,6823,0
Ahahahahaha!,12,113,1,-1,6824,0
You can just go to hell!,13,113,2,-1,6825,0
"No matter how many times I told you what
happened, you didn't do a thing!",14,113,2,-1,6826,0
So don't try acting like a father to me!,15,113,2,-1,6827,0
Akane... Please listen to me. Just this once.,16,21,3,-1,6828,0
"You're right. I couldn't catch the person
who took your mother's life.",17,21,3,-1,6829,0
"I understand why you'd want nothing to do
with a father who kept his head down and
took it.",18,21,3,-1,6830,0
"But if you don't snap out of it, they're gonna
get you too!",19,21,2,-1,6831,0
Now wake up!,20,21,2,-1,6832,0
"You say you couldn't catch him? It's more like
you didn't want to catch him.",21,113,0,-1,6833,0
"That monster who killed Mom... You knew
it was Owada!",22,113,2,-1,6834,0
Owada!?,23,2,2,-1,6835,0
"As in Owada the legislator, one of the
masterminds we seek!?",24,4,2,-1,6836,0
"It happened right in front of me! Owada ran
Mom over without a hint of regret!",25,113,2,-1,6837,0
"I told you, the police, and everyone I could
think of! But even then, he wasn't arrested!",26,113,2,-1,6838,0
......,27,21,3,-1,6839,0
"Why is that? Why does he get to take an
innocent life?",28,113,0,-1,6840,0
Aren't the police supposed to do what's right!?,29,113,2,-1,6841,0
Well...,30,21,3,-1,6842,0
......,31,21,3,-1,6843,0
......,32,113,0,-1,6844,0
"Zenkichi-san, tell her!",33,5,2,-1,6845,0
Niijima...,34,21,3,-1,6846,0
"Akane-chan isn't just angry in the moment.
She's been consumed with frustration ever
since she lost her mother!",35,5,2,-1,6847,0
"Until you tell her the truth, she's going to keep
playing this over and over in her heart!",36,5,2,-1,6848,0
"And if you do nothing, she'll never move past it!",37,5,2,-1,6849,1
Have faith in her.,38,0,-1,-1,-1,0
Tell her the truth.,39,0,-1,-1,-1,0
What happened?,40,0,-1,-1,-1,0
......,41,21,3,-1,6850,0
"After your mom died, I was taken off the case.",42,21,3,-1,6851,0
"They reasoned that a family member couldn't
judge impartially.",43,21,3,-1,6852,0
"Soon after, that secretary ended his own life...
leaving behind a note saying he was the one
responsible.",44,21,3,-1,6853,0
"No one else spoke up to contradict that.
To the police, it seemed like solid proof.",45,21,3,-1,6854,0
"Eventually, they concluded the secretary was at
fault and left it at that. To them, the case was as
good as closed.",46,21,3,-1,6855,0
"Akane, when you told me what really happened,
I knew that note was fake. So without skipping
a beat, I opened up my own investigation.",47,21,3,-1,6856,0
"But no matter what I found as proof, it'd get
wiped one way or another before I could
bring it to light.",48,21,3,-1,6857,0
"So you gave up, right? Your sense of justice
sure didn't get you very far...",49,113,0,-1,6858,0
Akane... I made a promise to Aoi...,50,21,5,-1,6859,0
That I'd protect you... No matter what the case.,51,21,5,-1,6860,0
What...?,52,113,0,-1,6861,0
"At that point, you were my only reason to
live. I didn't want to lose more family.",53,21,3,-1,6862,0
"So I promised Aoi I'd never let anything
happen to you... even if it killed me.",54,21,3,-1,6863,0
Saying that doesn't change anything.,55,113,0,-1,6864,0
"One day, I received a threat letter in the mail...
telling me to either stop my investigation...",56,21,5,-1,6865,0
Or my daughter dies.,57,21,5,-1,6866,0
Wha—!?,58,113,19,-1,6867,0
How could they...,59,5,4,-1,6868,0
"That's when I realized there was definitely evil
in this world.",60,21,5,-1,6869,0
"And in the end, one man is nothing compared to
the forces of darkness.",61,21,5,-1,6870,0
Gramps...,62,1,5,-1,6871,0
"I will never forgive Owada! Even though I can't
lay a finger on him...",63,21,5,-1,6872,0
"If it weren't for my current boss, I'd still be
wallowing in despair.",64,21,5,-1,6873,0
"I decided I'd do whatever it takes to help her
reach the top.",65,21,5,-1,6874,0
"All the while thinking it was the only way to
protect Akane and honor Aoi's memory.",66,21,5,-1,6875,0
...And I was even prepared to use all of you without a second thought.,67,21,5,-1,6876,0
Zenkichi...,68,7,3,-1,6877,0
*snicker* Ahahahahaha!,69,113,1,-1,6878,0
Akane-chan...,70,6,3,-1,6879,0
"See!? You hear that just now!? He's nothing but
a scheming manipulator!",71,113,0,-1,6880,0
"As long as he gets his way, he'll hang you all
out to dry!",72,113,0,-1,6881,0
How could you say that...?,73,3,2,-1,6882,0
"Did you not get that he's been tryin' to keep you
safe!?",74,1,2,-1,6883,0
"Oh, I know what he was trying to do.",75,113,0,-1,6884,0
"But to do it, he sacrificed his values as an officer.",76,113,0,-1,6885,0
Akane...,77,21,3,-1,6886,0
"If it was only us, I'd get it. We're family. Mom
would think so, too.",78,113,0,-1,6887,0
"But what about the secretary who died?
Did you ever stop to think what his family's
going through!?",79,113,2,-1,6888,0
......!,80,21,21,-1,6889,0
"Not only did they lose a loved one, they have
Mom's death hanging over their heads!
Did you forget that!?",81,113,2,-1,6890,0
Or did you choose to forget on purpose!?,82,113,2,-1,6891,0
I... had no idea you were thinking of them...,83,21,4,-1,6892,0
"You're just like the trash who killed Mom...
Pretending nothing ever happened.",84,113,0,-1,6893,0
I'm... like Owada...?,85,21,4,-1,6894,0
"You and the police just sit on your asses all day,
letting the bad guys roam free.",86,113,0,-1,6895,0
You people can't save anyone.,87,113,0,-1,6896,0
But I can... I'm the only one who cares.,88,113,0,-1,6897,0
"I'll change that evil bastard's heart so Mom can
rest in peace!",89,113,0,-1,6898,0
......!,90,21,4,-1,6899,0
I'll beat down every last villain in this world!,91,113,2,-1,6900,0
Akane-chan...,92,5,3,-1,6901,0
Is this... why you became a Monarch?,93,21,5,-1,6902,0
"Because I sacrificed others to keep what little
family I have alive?",94,21,5,-1,6903,0
"And this... is all my doing. You're like this
because of me...",95,21,5,-1,6904,0
Was I wrong... this whole time?,96,21,5,-1,6905,0
Zenkichi?,97,3,0,-1,6906,0
It's true. I used whoever I could.,98,21,3,-1,6907,0
"As long as my daughter was safe, it didn't matter
what anyone else suffered.",99,21,3,-1,6908,0
What else was I supposed to do?,100,21,3,-1,6909,0
I was trying to protect my family!,101,21,5,-1,6910,0
It's what anyone would've done!,102,21,5,-1,6911,0
Anyone!,103,21,5,-1,6912,0
Anyone but a man of justice.,104,-1,-1,442,6913,0
Who's there!?,105,21,17,-1,6914,0
Are you sure you weren't at fault?,106,-1,-1,442,6915,0
Who's talking to me!?,107,21,2,-1,6916,0
"You knew what it would cost
to give up the chase.",108,-1,-1,442,6917,0
"Yet you fled from the truth. Convinced
yourself it was right and just, with your
daughter's name hollow upon your lips.",109,-1,-1,442,6918,0
"You are as guilty as those you hate—a foul
villain, rotten to the core!",110,-1,-1,442,6919,0
"That's... No, I...!",111,21,5,-1,6920,0
"You traded away the justice you'd
built. You bought your comfort,
bribed your guilt.",112,-1,-1,442,6921,0
Heheheheh... HAHAHAHAHA!,113,-1,-1,442,6922,0
Zenkichi?,114,10,4,-1,6923,0
"Zenkichi, what happened!? Snap out of it!",115,2,4,-1,6924,0
He's right... It's all true.,116,21,3,-1,6925,0
"I let Aoi's murderer run free, and used the 
Phantom Thieves solely for my benefit.",117,21,3,-1,6926,0
I'm just as rotten as those criminals...,118,21,3,-1,6927,0
"I don't have the right to lecture Akane... I never
did to begin with.",119,21,3,-1,6928,1
Don't lose sight of yourself.,120,0,-1,-1,-1,0
Stand up and fight.,121,0,-1,-1,-1,0
You need to save Akane.,122,0,-1,-1,-1,0
Who I am...?,123,21,5,-1,6929,0
Fight...?,124,21,5,-1,6930,0
Save her...?,125,21,5,-1,6931,0
"That's right, Zenkichi! Wake up!",126,7,2,-1,6932,0
"Maybe you did stuff your emotions away, but
it was for your family's sake.",127,7,2,-1,6933,0
"You did it to protect Akane, the daughter you
love!",128,7,2,-1,6934,0
"My mom was the same! She worked as hard as
she could every day, doing what she believed
was right!",129,7,2,-1,6935,0
So stop blaming yourself!,130,7,2,-1,6936,0
"If you want to blame someone, blame those
monsters that hurt your family!",131,7,2,-1,6937,0
"Yeah, don't lose sight of your target!",132,1,2,-1,6938,0
"Your devotion to your daughter is what matters.
Torturing yourself over that would be a waste!",133,4,2,-1,6939,0
"Now look deep within your heart and find
your way forward!",134,4,2,-1,6940,0
Guys...,135,21,5,-1,6941,0
"Be strong, Zenkichi.",136,10,2,-1,6942,0
"Please, get back up! This is something only you
can do!",137,6,2,-1,6943,0
"The real enemies are still out there. Bring them
down for Akane-chan's sake!",138,5,2,-1,6944,0
......,139,21,5,-1,6945,0
...You're right.,140,21,5,-1,6946,0
"The real threat is still out there... Those who
ruin lives and tear families apart without a
second thought.",141,21,5,-1,6947,0
How stupid have I been?,142,21,3,-1,6948,0
"My own daughter tells me how to do my job,
and then these kids start lecturing me...",143,21,3,-1,6949,0
"I may not be a hero, and I sure as hell don't
deserve any awards...",144,21,3,-1,6950,0
But at least I know what makes a person evil.,145,21,5,-1,6951,0
"Evil only cares about itself. It's the mark of a man
who would bring another to ruin and dare not
show remorse.",146,21,5,-1,6952,0
"I will never let people like that go free. And
I'll give everything I have to bring them down!",147,21,2,-1,6953,0
