"They're not here yet, huh?",0,21,3,-1,6048,0
"Guess I'm a little early. Maybe I'll just keep
working on the...",1,21,3,-1,6049,0
What the hell!?,2,21,4,-1,6050,0
"Whoa, speak of the devil. Uh... Well, you guys
got here quick.",3,21,0,-1,6051,0
I thought we were gonna die...,4,15,5,-1,6052,0
"I think we already did... My soul's barely
tethered to my body.",5,85,5,-1,6053,0
Urp—gonna puke...,6,13,8,-1,6054,0
O...kay?,7,21,4,-1,6055,0
"My apologies, Haru, but I request you steer
clear of the driver's seat from now on. I only
have so many lives left...",8,16,5,-1,6056,0
......,9,2,10,-1,6057,0
Meowgana's unconscious. Wake him up.,10,20,0,-1,6058,0
"Hey, Okumura. What happened?",11,21,3,-1,6059,0
Um... I was just driving normally... I think.,12,84,0,-1,6060,0
Whew... The room finally stopped spinning.,13,15,3,-1,6061,0
"You have a very, uh, ""unique"" way of driving,
Haru.",14,2,3,-1,6062,0
"Why thank you, Mona-chan.",15,84,1,-1,6063,0
She really shouldn't take it as a compliment...,16,85,3,-1,6064,0
"Regardless, I'm glad you guys made it here in
one piece.",17,21,0,-1,6065,0
"By the way, what is this place? It seems unfit for
a typical gathering of law enforcement.",18,16,0,-1,6066,0
"You could call it my secret base, I guess.
Basically, it's a place to hole up if shit
ever goes south.",19,21,0,-1,6067,0
A good friend of mine used to run it.,20,21,0,-1,6068,0
"But now it's just an empty old bar, suitable for
investigating far away from any prying eyes.",21,21,0,-1,6069,0
So this is like your hideout.,22,20,0,-1,6070,0
"More like a safe room— No, a safe house!",23,85,0,-1,6071,0
"Those newspapers... Are they not from two years
prior?",24,16,0,-1,6072,0
"Those newspapers are irrelevant. We have
other business to discuss here.",25,21,3,-1,6073,0
"Then let's hear it, Zenkichi.",26,2,0,-1,6074,0
All right. Let me break it down for you bit by bit.,27,21,0,-1,6075,0
"I cross-referenced every name on the list we
found in Okinawa.",28,21,0,-1,6076,0
"Based on our assumption that the mastermind
would stand to benefit from changing hearts
en masse...",29,21,0,-1,6077,0
This is who we ended up with.,30,21,0,-1,6078,0
Yeah... He sure looks like a schemey bastard.,31,13,12,-1,6079,0
"Don't I know it... To think he'd turn up now
of all times...",32,21,3,-1,6080,1
Something wrong?,33,12,-1,-1,-1,0
Do you know him?,34,12,-1,-1,-1,0
"...No, not in particular.",35,21,3,-1,6081,0
"Anyway, the man's name is Jyun Owada. At 69
years old, he's on his tenth term as a legislator.",36,21,0,-1,6082,0
"Not only that, but he worked his way up to
Chief Cabinet Secretary of the ruling party.
In short, he's not someone to mess with.",37,21,0,-1,6083,0
"They say he was a Masayoshi Shido supporter
during the election last year.",38,21,0,-1,6084,0
Did you say Shido!?,39,2,4,-1,6085,0
"Unbelievable... I never thought I'd hear his
name again.",40,16,2,-1,6086,0
Do you know him?,41,20,0,-1,6087,1
He was our former enemy.,42,12,-1,-1,-1,0
He was a powerful foe.,43,12,-1,-1,-1,0
I'd rather not remember.,44,12,-1,-1,-1,0
"Yeah, and one HELL of an evil asshole.",45,13,12,-1,6088,0
"Man, he totally tried to screw up your entire
life... I get why you'd wanna block him out.",46,13,12,-1,6089,0
Oh... I didn't know.,47,20,2,-1,6090,0
"Sounds like you and Shido had quite the
history. But we're not after him right now.",48,21,0,-1,6091,0
"That list contained a handful of Owada's
political opponents—people he'd rather
not have around.",49,21,0,-1,6092,0
So it's clear he's behind all this.,50,21,0,-1,6093,0
"However, I highly doubt he's doing his own
dirty work. He'd have a heck of a time getting
his political opponents to friend him on EMMA.",51,21,3,-1,6094,0
"After checking his inner circle for sympathizers,
I found out he's been meeting with a certain
entrepreneur. Quite often, too.",52,21,0,-1,6095,1
The CEO of Madicce?,53,12,-1,-1,-1,0
Is it Shido?,54,12,-1,-1,-1,0
"It's not you, is it?",55,12,-1,-1,-1,0
"Nice guess. It's the CEO of Madicce all right:
Akira Konoe.",56,21,1,-1,6096,0
"I told you, he's not our guy. It's the CEO of
Madicce: Akira Konoe.",57,21,0,-1,6097,0
"Are you tryin' to piss me off? Look, it's the CEO
of Madicce: Akira Konoe.",58,21,2,-1,6098,0
"Isn't the CEO of Madicce the guy we heard 
speak back in Sendai?",59,15,4,-1,6099,0
"I came across communication records between
him and the director at Okinawa... and it
showed they kept in contact.",60,21,0,-1,6100,0
Then the pieces all fit.,61,17,2,-1,6101,0
Yeah.,62,21,0,-1,6102,0
"Whenever Owada wants someone out of his
way, he calls on Konoe to take action...",63,21,0,-1,6103,0
"And the director at Okinawa was likely the one who arranged this. Now, it's too late to tell.",64,21,0,-1,6104,0
"Hold on. If Konoe's the one changing hearts,
does that make him a Monarch too?",65,85,4,-1,6105,0
"But he's the CEO of Madicce. Wouldn't he get
one of his subordinates to do the job for him?",66,84,4,-1,6106,0
I suppose it would be natural to assume that.,67,21,0,-1,6107,0
"But as you all know, in order to change
someone's heart, you need to be their
friend on EMMA.",68,21,0,-1,6108,0
"Everyone Owada associates with is a big-time
elite. And Konoe's the only one in their league.",69,21,0,-1,6109,0
"Besides, he's the head of a huge company.
If anything, I think he'd want to be a Monarch
as well.",70,2,2,-1,6110,0
"He wouldn't want to risk his heart getting
changed by someone else, either.",71,2,2,-1,6111,0
"Another thing. The people on that list most
likely had their hearts changed in Osaka.",72,21,0,-1,6112,0
Huh? Why do you say that?,73,15,4,-1,6113,0
"Everyone on that list who went crazy had
all traveled to Osaka at some point.",74,21,0,-1,6114,0
That's also where Madicce's main office is.,75,21,0,-1,6115,0
"Meaning there's a good chance we'll find
a Jail in Osaka... with Konoe as its Monarch.",76,21,0,-1,6116,0
"Though, the only way we'll know for sure
is if Sophia senses it.",77,21,0,-1,6117,0
I did sense a Jail.,78,20,0,-1,6118,0
Huh!?,79,13,4,-1,6119,0
"Oh, right, we did pass through Osaka when I
took a wrong turn.",80,84,4,-1,6120,0
"Sophia, you shoulda spoken up!",81,13,4,-1,6121,0
"I did speak up. But you guys were too busy
to listen.",82,20,0,-1,6122,0
If it was when Haru was driving...,83,15,3,-1,6123,0
"Then we were likely too busy screaming
for our lives...",84,16,3,-1,6124,0
Hm?,85,84,4,-1,6125,0
"Well, that certainly makes things easier.
So it's confirmed there's a Jail in Osaka.",86,21,0,-1,6126,0
"Now we just need to determine whether
Konoe's the Monarch or not.",87,21,0,-1,6127,0
"Wait, if you know that much already, why not
cuff his ass right now!?",88,13,12,-1,6128,1
We have no proof.,89,12,-1,-1,-1,0
There's a reason.,90,12,-1,-1,-1,0
I agree.,91,12,-1,-1,-1,0
Right. Now here's the issue.,92,21,3,-1,6129,0
There's a problem with that.,93,21,3,-1,6130,0
"That list only spells out his motives and
connections. It isn't solid proof that
he's been changing hearts.",94,21,0,-1,6131,0
"We can't arrest him on speculation alone.
The most we can do is conduct a search,
and that's only with his consent.",95,21,0,-1,6132,0
"Hell, he could pack up and run if he wanted to.
We don't have any legal authority over him.",96,21,0,-1,6133,0
"Another thing I noticed is how many high-
ranking members of the force were on that list.",97,21,3,-1,6134,0
"You think he's changed their hearts too?
To get the police in his pocket?",98,17,4,-1,6135,0
"Yeah, and from the look of it, not just the
rank-and-file, either.",99,21,3,-1,6136,0
"So that's why you called us here... Because you
don't know who the real enemies are.",100,17,2,-1,6137,0
"The most I can do without being traced is some
light investigation. And even then, that might be
impossible.",101,21,3,-1,6138,0
"If it's the top brass we're dealing with, they
might just leak the info and take action before I
can lift a finger.",102,21,3,-1,6139,0
"In other words, the police are not our allies.",103,16,2,-1,6140,0
"Heh, what else is new?",104,13,1,-1,6141,0
...You do realize I'm also a man in uniform?,105,21,8,-1,6142,0
"Anyway, it's obvious that going about this the
regular way is out of the question.",106,21,3,-1,6143,0
"What we need is something a bit more
uncanny... Something only you guys are
capable of.",107,21,0,-1,6144,1
You want us to change his heart?,108,12,-1,-1,-1,0
You want us to torture him?,109,12,-1,-1,-1,0
You want us to kidnap him?,110,12,-1,-1,-1,0
"Right. If Konoe really is a Monarch, we can
corner him into a confession.",111,21,0,-1,6145,0
"Come on, I can do that on my own— Wait, like
hell I can! That's illegal!",112,21,2,-1,6146,0
"If our hunch is right, and he really is the
Monarch, we can grab a confession out of him!",113,21,0,-1,6147,0
"That's right. We completely overlooked the
fact that Konoe has a Jail.",114,2,2,-1,6148,0
But won't we need a keyword to gain access?,115,17,0,-1,6149,0
Precisely why I had you rush over here.,116,21,0,-1,6150,0
"I'll be meeting Konoe at Madicce's
corporate headquarters today.",117,21,0,-1,6151,0
Really? How'd you manage that?,118,15,4,-1,6152,0
"By going about it like a cop. Told 'em we had
intel about a possible security leak involving
their software.",119,21,0,-1,6153,0
"""We received information about a possible
party attempting to hack EMMA,"" so on and
so forth.",120,21,0,-1,6154,0
"Ooh, does somebody need a hacker?",121,85,0,-1,6155,0
"Not even that. I only said it to score me an
appointment.",122,21,0,-1,6156,0
"At the end of it, I'll suggest he add me on EMMA
so I can answer any further questions, and we'll
have ourselves a keyword.",123,21,0,-1,6157,0
"In his mind, I'll be just another pawn for the
taking. So I'm pretty sure he'll take the bait.",124,21,0,-1,6158,0
"The moment I get the keyword—if I get the
keyword—I'll send it right over.",125,21,1,-1,6159,0
"That's what I've been meaning to tell you.
Hope it was worth the drive.",126,21,0,-1,6160,0
"Wait, if you're gonna hit up their office, that
means you're goin' to Osaka, right? Let us
come with.",127,13,0,-1,6161,0
"The sooner we enter the Jail, the sooner we can
finish this operation.",128,16,0,-1,6162,0
"Fair, but there's a chance I might not get the
keyword. Tagging along for nothing would
be a wasted effort.",129,21,3,-1,6163,0
"Besides, doesn't Niijima need a breather?
In fact, you all look like you need one.",130,21,0,-1,6164,0
Can't really argue with that...,131,17,3,-1,6165,0
"Bottom line is, if you guys go down,
so does everything I've worked for.",132,21,0,-1,6166,0
So I need you fighting at your best.,133,21,0,-1,6167,0
Got it. So our job's to wait until further contact.,134,2,2,-1,6168,0
"What the hell, now we gotta wait even more?",135,13,3,-1,6169,0
"Oh? You really wanna complain, right when I'm
about to tell you the big surprise I have in store
for you?",136,21,1,-1,6170,0
What big surprise?,137,84,4,-1,6171,0
