"...So I went to talk to Hyodo, but nothing new
came out of it.",0,21,0,-1,4543,0
"All she explained is that she could control 
whoever added her as a friend on EMMA.",1,21,0,-1,4544,1
So we're back to square one.,2,12,-1,-1,-1,0
That's unfortunate.,3,12,-1,-1,-1,0
What about her phone?,4,12,-1,-1,-1,0
"Come on, don't give me that look. 
Here, I at least got her smartphone.",5,21,0,-1,4545,0
"Not to worry, I have it with me. Here.",6,21,0,-1,4546,0
Now that's what I wanna see!,7,19,1,-1,4547,0
"After reviewing the facts, I've just about
confirmed it.",8,2,2,-1,4548,0
"Each of these so-called incidents... I think
they all stemmed from a mastermind.",9,2,2,-1,4549,0
Oh? I'm curious as to why you think so.,10,21,0,-1,4550,0
"Hyodo, Natsume, Alice...",11,2,2,-1,4551,0
"All three were changing people's hearts to do
bad things, but deep down, none of them were
truly evil.",12,2,2,-1,4552,0
"At the very least, they're not the same as the
rulers who distorted reality for their own sakes
and ended up spawning Palaces.",13,2,2,-1,4553,0
"I'd been considering that as well. Before
Natsume lost sight of his writing, he was
diligently working toward his dreams.",14,16,3,-1,4554,0
"Alice, too. She was doing her very best to 
be a ray of light and hope for other people.",15,15,3,-1,4555,0
"Mari-san was also striving for the betterment of
everyone in Sapporo...",16,84,0,-1,4556,0
"Right... They're different from criminal scum
like Kamoshida and Madarame, who acted
only for their own benefit.",17,2,2,-1,4557,0
"Okay, but how does a handful of not-so-evil
Monarchs prove there's a mastermind behind
all this?",18,21,3,-1,4558,0
"The fact that Jails are fundamentally different
from Palaces provides us a big clue.",19,2,2,-1,4559,0
"For starters, Jails don't have any Treasures for
the taking. All we've found are people's stolen
Desires.",20,2,2,-1,4560,0
That means Monarchs don't have twisted enough wills to reshape reality and form Treasures.,21,2,2,-1,4561,0
"Which would mean that Jails aren't created by
the Monarchs themselves... Someone else must
be doing the creating.",22,17,0,-1,4562,0
Our final clue is the locks on all those birdcages.,23,2,2,-1,4563,0
"In order to get to the Monarch, we've always had
to unlock a door that denies us passage.",24,2,2,-1,4564,0
"I had thought this was just a security measure
designed to protect the Monarch and the
Desires held within...",25,2,2,-1,4565,0
"But if that were the case, why would traumatic
memories the Monarch would rather erase
be the key to unlocking it?",26,2,2,-1,4566,0
"Given that these are cognitive worlds, maybe it
means Monarchs think their trauma will protect
them.",27,17,2,-1,4567,0
"I find that rather odd... If anything, I would think
it's the other way around.",28,16,2,-1,4568,0
"Correct. What if it is the other way around?
Why might a door like that exist?",29,2,2,-1,4569,1
To keep the Monarch confined?,30,12,-1,-1,-1,0
To keep the Monarch out?,31,12,-1,-1,-1,0
To make the Monarch feel safe?,32,12,-1,-1,-1,0
"Right. I think so, too.",33,2,2,-1,4570,0
"No, it's nastier than that.",34,2,2,-1,4571,0
"What if that door isn't to keep intruders out,
but to trap Monarchs in?",35,2,2,-1,4572,0
You mean they're trapped...?,36,84,4,-1,4573,0
I thought the Monarchs are the ones in charge...,37,13,4,-1,4574,0
"Think about it. What would happen if a Monarch
tried leaving their cage?",38,2,2,-1,4575,0
"They'd touch the door... and then hear the
voices of their trauma?",39,15,4,-1,4576,0
"Exactly. They'll remember what made them
so warped in the first place, and stick to their
guns as a Monarch.",40,2,2,-1,4577,0
"And thus, the cycle continues unbroken.
The Monarchs really are birds in a cage.",41,2,2,-1,4578,0
"From that perspective, the Shadows protecting
the keys inside the Trauma Cell hold a far more
sinister purpose.",42,16,2,-1,4579,0
"They aren't there to prevent the Monarch's
trauma from being discovered...",43,16,2,-1,4580,0
"They're wardens guarding an elaborate system
to ensure the Monarch's imprisonment.",44,16,2,-1,4581,0
Let me get this straight...,45,21,3,-1,4582,0
"You're basically saying these Monarchs are
being manipulated. And by virtue of that,
there's somebody doing the manipulating.",46,21,0,-1,4583,0
How's Hyodo-san's smartphone looking?,47,15,0,-1,4584,0
"Nothing wrong with her phone or the EMMA
installed. But I did find traces of surveillance.",48,85,0,-1,4585,0
"I'll bet it's the same snooper we keep running
into, though I'm lost as to who it might be.",49,85,0,-1,4586,0
"So this observer and our mastermind may just 
be one and the same... Anyone have any guesses?",50,21,0,-1,4587,0
"Our first suspect is Madicce, the company
in charge of EMMA.",51,2,2,-1,4588,0
"Since you can't get into Jails without EMMA, 
I can't write it off as mere coincidence.",52,2,2,-1,4589,0
"Madicce, huh... Too bad we can't just storm
their headquarters.",53,21,3,-1,4590,0
Y'mean the cops can't actually do that?,54,13,0,-1,4591,0
"Of course not. How could we even put out a
warrant on them? By saying they go around
turning people into Monarchs?",55,21,3,-1,4592,0
"[1B]S1, you have a call from Ichinose.",56,20,0,-1,4593,0
"Hi there! Sorry for the relative lapse in
communication. But I did turn up some info
that I thought you guys might like to know!",57,106,1,-1,4594,0
"So I've been looking into EMMA all this time,
and I still have yet to find any differences
between her past and present versions.",58,106,0,-1,4595,0
"I mean, this is state-of-the-art tech.
Not something just anybody could
pry open and take a look inside...",59,106,0,-1,4596,0
"But then I took a peek at EMMA's changelog...
and that's where things got interesting.",60,106,0,-1,4597,0
"It seems EMMA was transported to Okinawa
at some point after I sold her to Madicce.",61,106,0,-1,4598,1
Why Okinawa?,62,12,-1,-1,-1,0
Why is that important?,63,12,-1,-1,-1,0
"Yes! Exactly! ""Why"" was the first thing that
popped into my head! So I dug around some
more.",64,106,1,-1,4599,0
"And I found that off the coast of Okinawa, on the
island of Kukojima... Madicce apparently has a
research lab!",65,106,0,-1,4600,0
"Oddly enough, its existence is unknown to the
public, and when I called to ask for records,
nothing came up.",66,106,0,-1,4601,0
"Basically, they're running a secret research lab!
How crazy is that?",67,106,0,-1,4602,0
"So, if EMMA's been altered in any way, I would
think it had to have been done on that island.",68,106,0,-1,4603,0
"Well, guys? Wasn't I a super-stellar source of information!?",69,106,0,-1,4604,1
You saved us.,70,12,-1,-1,-1,0
Well done.,71,12,-1,-1,-1,0
"Yeah, keep it up.",72,12,-1,-1,-1,0
"Ooh, is that praise I hear? You mean I did a good
job!? Woohoo, go me!",73,106,1,-1,4605,0
"You just leave it to me! I've become rather fond
of investigating, actually.",74,106,1,-1,4606,0
"Welp, guess it's bye for now, Phantom Thieves!
Please regale me with tales of your adventure
another time!",75,106,1,-1,4607,0
So what'd Ichinose-san say?,76,15,0,-1,4608,0
Okinawa!?,77,17,4,-1,4609,0
Crystal-clear waters!?,78,15,4,-1,4610,0
Shiisaa statues!?,79,84,4,-1,4611,0
Juicy pineapples!?,80,85,4,-1,4612,0
Chinsuko cookies!?,81,16,4,-1,4613,1
Okinawa soba!,82,12,-1,-1,-1,0
Sugarcane!,83,12,-1,-1,-1,0
"Ooh, that too! It's that ramen-like thing, yeah?",84,13,1,-1,4614,0
That's... not what I was expecting.,85,13,4,-1,4615,0
"Guys, can you snap out of it?",86,2,2,-1,4616,0
"If it's an unregistered facility, we could always
say we're conducting a field survey; that way
we could ensure their cooperation.",87,21,3,-1,4617,0
"We may even find proper evidence that could
be used in court. It may be well worth going...",88,21,3,-1,4618,0
"But, Kukojima is a bit far from the Okinawa
mainland...",89,21,8,-1,4619,0
Then I guess we'd have to go by plane...,90,21,8,-1,4620,0
"Wait, what about our precious Feathermobile!?
We've taken it all this way!",91,85,4,-1,4621,0
THAT'S what you're namin' this thing?,92,13,3,-1,4622,0
"Plus, you said it'd be dangerous using public
transportation...",93,84,0,-1,4623,0
"Even so, wouldn't it be too complicated to try
to reach Okinawa by car?",94,16,0,-1,4624,0
...Gimme a sec.,95,21,3,-1,4625,0
"Hey, what's up? Yeah... yeah...",96,21,0,-1,4626,0
"Of course I'm aware. But I also have a job
to do, you know... Hahaha...",97,21,3,-1,4627,0
Who's he talkin' to?,98,13,0,-1,4628,0
"Why would I lie? I'm being honest, I swear.",99,21,4,-1,4629,0
"...Of course I remember! Thing is, I'm a little...
Well...",100,21,3,-1,4630,0
Oh.,101,21,4,-1,4631,0
...You got hung up on.,102,85,0,-1,4632,0
"Okay, guys, plane's a no-go. We're driving.",103,21,0,-1,4633,0
Huh?,104,13,4,-1,4634,0
"You mean we're going all the way to Okinawa
by car!?",105,15,4,-1,4635,0
"The thing is, I need to make a stop along the
way. So we'll be heading to Kyoto first.",106,21,0,-1,4636,0
Did you say Kyoto!?,107,16,21,-1,4637,1
Why Kyoto?,108,12,-1,-1,-1,0
What's this about?,109,12,-1,-1,-1,0
"Yeah, I primarily work for the Kyoto Police
Department. I thought I'd take a moment
to catch up, share intel... y'know, cop stuff.",110,21,0,-1,4638,0
"After that, we head to Kobe; we can take a direct
ferry to Okinawa from there. That ought to cut
down on time.",111,21,0,-1,4639,0
"But that's still quite a distance, even to Kyoto...",112,17,3,-1,4640,0
Not to worry. I'll do the driving.,113,21,0,-1,4641,0
You're taggin' along!?,114,13,4,-1,4642,0
"Wait, am I to believe that Niijima's been doing
all the driving? Okumura, I thought you already
had your license.",115,21,3,-1,4643,0
"I do have it, it's just... I don't have much
experience behind the wheel.",116,84,3,-1,4644,0
"Plus, Haru's driving is not exactly... Uhm...",117,17,4,-1,4645,0
"Well, in any case, we're taking off immediately.",118,21,0,-1,4646,0
"If we're leaving from here, you'll need to take
the Hokuriku Expressway. The estimated travel
time will be...",119,20,0,-1,4647,0
"About 21 hours, give or take.",120,21,0,-1,4648,0
Gramps is correct.,121,20,4,-1,4649,0
21 HOURS!? Are you nuts?,122,13,4,-1,4650,0
"You forget I'm an officer of the law?
We're badass at driving.",123,21,1,-1,4651,0
"What's with him all of a sudden... It's like he lit
a fire under his ass.",124,13,3,-1,4652,0
"Fine by me, so long as I can visit Kyoto at last!",125,16,1,-1,4653,0
"There goes Inari, revealing his true colors.",126,85,0,-1,4654,1
Ready when you are.,127,12,-1,-1,-1,0
Drive safe.,128,12,-1,-1,-1,0
Pedal to the medal!,129,12,-1,-1,-1,0
"All right, then let's hit the road! I'll get you
rascals there in record time!",130,21,1,-1,4655,0
