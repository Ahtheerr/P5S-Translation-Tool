"All right, let's begin the operation!"
"That was one hell of an entrance, Joker!
They're all riled up!"
"Just keep at it! Go ham until you've drawn
every last bit of attention!"
"Everyone else, proceed as planned!
Joker's got the diversion covered,
so now's your time to shine!"
Gotcha. Leave the searchlights to us!
"And we're to support Oracle as she
hacks the terminal?"
"Right. Let's secure the area in front
of the gate first."
"Yes, yes! Slice 'em and dice 'em!"
"Mweheheh, the enemy's starting to
swarm Joker... Teach 'em a lesson!"
"Joker's got the enemy BIG time mad!
Awesome job—just a bit longer!"
"He's doing it all by himself, too...
Now that's our Joker!"
"I bet Skull wouldn't pull it off that
smoothly."
The hell's with this déjà vu?
"Hmm? Look out, we've got incoming!"
"Dammit! Fine, let's do this! We'll
take ALL of you on!"
"Stay sharp, you two! We haven't
fought in some time."
"Just warm up a bit for starters. It'll
come back to you soon enough!"
"Heh, don't forget who you're talkin'
to—this is the offense duty champ!"
"That's what I like to see, Skull!
We should get in there too!"
Joker—use your Persona!
"That's it, Joker! Now let's finish them off!"
You're done for!
"Heh, you AND your shield can say
goodbye!"
"So it's not just the outfits—we even
got our Personas, huh?"
"And there's a ton of Shadows here
too... What the hell is this place?"
I'm getting a feeling... Is this a...?
"Wait, we're trapped!? What do we
do now!?"
"Who could do this? Well, let's take
these Shadows out and see if it
disappears!"
"Reinforcements... If this keeps up
much longer, we'll be done for."
"We should make good use of our
surroundings. See anything that
could give you the advantage?"
"Great show, Joker! You really
did 'em in with that one!"
My head... is spinnin'...
Skull! Keep it together!
All right! That'll show 'em!
"Y'all are WAY too weak! Don't even
try stepping to us again!"
"Looks like the cage around us
is gone."
Hmm?
Joker! Skull! Watch out!
The hell... Even more of 'em!?
"We're getting surrounded fast...
We have to retreat!"
"Guys—over there! That looks like
our best bet!"
Let's move it!
"This place is disgusting. Who just
dumps people into garbage like
that?"
"Let's find a way out as soon as
possible."
"We don't know what we'll run into,
either—let's keep an eye on how
we're holding up as we press on."
Where the hell'd they come from!?
"Nobody's coming for us if we go
down here. Let's get 'em!"
"All right, let's be careful."
"We'd be fine, but we don't want to
endanger Sophia. Try staying out of
sight."
Wait! A Shadow!
Holy shit! She just beat 'em!
No way... Was that a Persona!?
Who the— What are you doing!?
"I am helping the Phantom Thieves.
Don't take it personally."
"...In that case, let's get in there too!"
"Oh, right—keep track of how
you're holding up. Need any
healing items?"
"Check anything suspicious-looking.
Never know what you might find..."
"Shadows incoming! A whole load
of 'em... Get ready!"
"There are more ways to target an
enemy's weakness than skills alone,
remember?"
"Pow, Shadow down! Nice one. That
kind of shooting'll get you far!"
Now's our chance! Wipe 'em out!
"Stay on your toes, Joker—they've got
skills just like we do!"
"Hey Joker, you think you could find
your way up there?"
"Hmm, they've got numbers on their
side... but not enough to stop us!"
"Joker, show 'em who's boss!"
"Ooh! Looking cool, Joker!"
"Haha, man do you kick ass! I gotta
start catchin' up!"
"Wait—Shadows ahead! They haven't
spotted us yet."
"Should I ""wipe them out"" for you?"
"Here's a tip on us Phantom Thieves:
we avoid charging headfirst into
battle whenever possible."
Let's try those stairs for now.
Hey! Who's sneaking around here!?
"Looks like we're busted... We can
still use our surroundings to our
advantage, though."
"See that hanging there, Joker?
You thinking what I'm thinking?"
"Great, right where we want 'em!
Now let 'em have it!"
Nailed it!
"Looking cool, Joker!"
All that's left is moppin' up the rest!
"Yay, we won."
"Don't celebrate just yet... Aren't we
in a dead end?"
...There.
"If we climb there, we can proceed."
Guess there's no other option...
I've got eyes on them!
"They just don't quit! Let's take them
down, Joker!"
"Ooh, you got another Persona!
Looks like that power you've got
is alive and well!"
"The enemy became a mask?
Explain this."
"He seals a Shadow's form and power
into a mask, turning it into a Persona."
Oh. Interesting.
Enemy ahead!
"Joker, try that Persona you just got!"
"Let's focus on the big Shadow for
now!"
"How are you holding up? Make sure
you heal yourself when you need it."
"This leads further inward. Should we
investigate?"
"Nah, we should focus on our escape."
Hang on—it looks like this is the exit!
"Oh hell yes! Let's get our asses
OUTTA here!"
"Be careful—they've got serious
numbers."
"Don'tcha remember what to do at
times like this?"
"Watch for an opening, then jump it
from behind! Be careful not to get
spotted!"
"Now's your chance! Everyone, jump
in and take 'em out!"
"We did it! That ambush was a real
success."
"Indeed. It's been quite some time
since we fought last, but my body
is still ready for more."
"They'll go a lot smoother whenever
we ambush them like that, too."
"On the other hand, if we're spotted,
they'll get the upper hand against
us. Keep sharp out there."
"I guess now we just push forward
and see what we see? Navigator
at the ready!"
"Hang on there! Searchlights
confirmed!"
"Getting spotted by one of those'll
mean big trouble—surrounded in
no time."
"Shadows are patrolling, too...
No surprise, security is tight here."
"A frontal assault sounds like it might
be out of the picture."
"Let's see if we have anything else
here..."
"I said not that way! That's searchlight
territory!"
"Hey, look! Maybe we can get in there."
"Great! If we run along there, getting
in the castle should be a cinch."
"But there are more searchlights.
How will we get past?"
"They're smaller than the other ones,
why don't we just try sneakin' past?"
Wha— Holy shit!
"We can't go any further! They're
firing on anything within range."
"Oracle, can you find a way to shut
them down?"
Just a sec... Analyzing...
......
Yesss! Got it!
"The searchlights' power source is
south of here!"
"South... Yeah, which way's that?"
"In reality, it'd be somewhere around
Maruku City. Must be some sorta
facility providing power over there."
"All right, off to Maruku City! Let's
move out."
"The Jail looks like Shibuya, but the
layout isn't exactly the same... I'm
worried we'll get ourselves lost."
"Yeah, you should keep tabs on your
location or that'll probably happen!"
"Maruku City's straight ahead from
here. I'll highlight it on your map."
Wait—sentry!
"It has some kind of light, too..."
"Oh great. Once that thing sees us,
Shadows are just gonna start
pourin' in."
"We should avoid all head-on conflict
when possible. Life only gets harder
when they're on high alert."
"And if we're spotted too many times,
we'll have no choice but to come
back later."
"Let's look for an alternate route—
maybe one where we can stay
unseen."
There's a sentry here as well.
"Guess we just hafta take that one
out..."
"It looks like it hasn't noticed us yet,
though."
"Joker, think you could pull off an
ambush from over there?"
"Nice move, Joker!"
Well done.
"Taking down enemies doesn't get
any easier than an ambush!"
Oh! A treasure chest!
"Shit yeah! Let's stomp those guys
and loot that thing!"
"Wait! That treasure chest has a
security system!"
"If the security level here gets too
high, the chest is shielded until
things quiet back down again."
"If enemies spot us too many times,
no treasure for us. Got it."
"Damn, they saw us!"
"Oh, the treasure chest..."
Yes! It's all ours!
"Wave of Shadows incoming!
They're weak to [1B]M0~4~Electricity
and [1B]M0~2~Fire!"
"Can't strike their weakness? Try a
Baton Pass!"
"That takes care of that. Let's get
going."
Stoooooop! Maruku City's right here.
You mean on the other side of that?
"I don't see a way to open the gate,
either. Looks like we need an
alternative."
"Such as? I don't think we'll be able
to climb that."
"Look over there—what if we tried
going up that way?"
"At the very least, we might spot
a way around this from up there."
Good idea. Let's hop on up.
"Heeey, that's the wrong way!
Look at your objective markerrr!"
"Waugh, this is tight...! Think we can
really make it?"
"Whoooa! Look at that god-tier
balance!"
One moment. Something is nearby.
Something? What kinda something?
"It is a... space. Connected to...
somewhere."
"Hmmm!? Hey, Sophie! You're right!"
"It's like the space here is being
warped... and connected to... the
Crossing?"
"As in, the Crossing where we first
entered the Jail?"
"Sooo, if we use this, we'll go back to
the entrance?"
"Sounds like moving between the Jail
and the real world will make our
resupply efforts at least a bit easier."
"That's it: I'm callin' this a checkpoint!
Go ahead and give it a spin so the
location data registers."
"Oh? Do you intend to skip the
checkpoint?"
"It looks like this tunnel eventually
leads right under Maruku City."
"Tunnel? Looks more like a sewer to
me. And there's no easy way to get
to the other side..."
"Welp, looks like we're swimmin'."
"No, no, no. I am NOT swimming
in THAT. Not happening!"
"I would prefer not to as well... Can't
we search for another way?"
"...Hey, check out the grate."
"What do you think—could we use
that to get around?"
"Yeah, it's worth a try!"
"Gah, it's too cramped in here! I keep
runnin' into Panther's boots."
"Run into anything else back there
and I'll show you how much damage
these boots can really do."
"*gasp* No, please don't. For real."
"Hey, we came out right where we
wanted! I knew that was the right
move!"
"We should be able to traverse this
using the pipes."
Neat. Very thiefy.
"We ARE the Phantom Thieves, ya
know! You'll get it soon enough!"
I'll bet that leads to the surface.
Who the hell are you!?
Waugh! Busted!
"Can't have these guys raise a fuss
about us. Get rid of 'em, quick!"
"All good? Then out of the ""tunnel""
we go!"
"Heeey, we're just on the other side
of the wall! Well done, Thieves!"
"Great! Now the tower itself is all
that's left!"
"Lift those knees up. One two,
one two!"
"Oh yeah, made it!"
"All right, let's check out that light!"
"I wonder if the other cores are in jail-
cell-covered towers like this one..."
"Some form of shorthand reference
would be more convenient. How
does ""Incarceration Zone"" sound?"
"In-cars-or... what? Dude, why the
hell would we call it that?"
"These places are for protecting the
Jail's power sources, so... how about
""Prison Keeps""?"
"This is where Miyamae Park is
in the real world."
Is that our current destination?
"Well, that didn't take long."
"This one doesn't appear any easier
to breach, though."
"Looks like we're taking the long way
'round."
"Security is gonna be tight—let's stay
sharp."
Who's there!?
"Uh-oh, busted! Take 'em out before
they call for backup!"
"Hey, check out the skateboard! Feel
like shredding some Shadows?"
"Ooh, good call, Skull! I bet you
could mow down a whole gang
of Shadows if you did it right!"
"This gate's closed too. Maybe there's
another way in somewhere over
there?"
I can't see an entrance...
"Maybe we should gain some
elevation?"
That spot seems rather odd...
"Maybe we'll find something useful
there. C'mon, let's check it out!"
"Nice work! Now, to infiltrate the
Keep!"
"Aw, another locked door?
And we'd made it so far..."
"Hold up! I think I might be able to
hack this."
"Ooh, for real!?"
"Let's check out the terminal—at the
very least, I can give it a shot."
"Uh-huh, uh-huh... Great, I should
be able to work with this!"
"Okay, Oracle, we'll leave the door
to you."
"Time to get crackin'! Aaaaand, go!"
"Whoa, whoa! Where'd all these
Shadows come from!?"
"Uh-oh, busted! Keep 'em off of me,
guys!"
Everyone—protect Oracle!
Oracle! Report!
Almost there! Just a little bit longer!
"The Shadows are givin' me guff!
Somebody, help!"
This is not looking good... Heeelp!
"Yes, I did it!"
"That really freaked me out for a bit
there... Thanks for having my back."
"It seems any hacking attempts here
are met with reinforcements."
"Let's make sure Oracle's as prepared
as possible from here on out."
Wait—incoming Shadows!
"How'd you get in here!? Where are
the guards!?"
"In Her Majesty's name, you shall go
no further!"
Watch out! That one's extra tough!
"It's gotta have an opening
somewhere! Watch its
movements!"
"Ohhh, you guys rule!"
"Now it's just a climb to the top.
Full steam ahead!"
This core is Alice on a... book?
"She made the cover of UN UN?
That's a really famous magazine."
"A widely recognized symbol of
power. Mona's theory is being
proven with each turn."
"She would've been famous even if
she hadn't started doing all this..."
Panther...
"Then what reason did she have?
Does she even have one at all?"
"Whatever the case, the next core's
the last one."
"It's just a bit west of here! Over by
Bunkamachi."
"Bunkamachi? That's quite the
cultural hotspot."
"Returning to Shibuya Crossing and
using Central Street would probably
be quickest."
"Once you get past Central Street,
you'll be at Bunkamachi."
"Bunkamachi is home to a large
ballet hall as well."
"Ballet? Oh, I got it—where wealthy
people have others park their own
vehicles for them."
...That would be valet.
"Hey Noir, didn't you say you used
to do valet— I mean, ballet?"
"Yes, I was in a few recitals...
I still use valet service, though."
"How incredible. I would appreciate
witnessing your valet skills in action."
"You do know the ballet's what's more
impressive, right?"
"Ah, this looks like something for me
to get my paws on."
"Best of luck, Oracle—we'll have your
back from here."
"Yes, hacking complete! Moving on..."
Huh? What's that for?
"Hmm, looks like some kinda
generator."
Let there be light!
...No result. Could it be broken?
"No, it's feeding power somewhere..."
"Eh, why don't we just leave it for
now? We've got other shit to do."
"Look, it's another one of those
machines. I wonder what purpose
they serve..."
"Will you switch it on, Joker? Or will
you leave it be?"
Ummm... Did that do something?
Hellooooo?
"Frickin' nothing, that's what it did!"
"No point hangin' around here. Let's
move on, Joker."
"Oh, a third generator."
"What now, Joker? Plan on switching
it on?"
Nothing yet again?
"Oh? I think something's been turned
on!"
"So, third time was the charm, was it?"
"Looks like the power is running
up ahead of us. Let's check it out!"
"Hey, isn't this like one of the other
terminals you've been hacking,
Oracle?"
"Sounds like we need you for this one
too. Think you can do it?"
"Hmm, the screen's not on. I don't
think it's powered up."
"It can't be hacked? But, we have
nowhere else to go."
"Oh, right! I think I remember
spotting some huge machine
on Central Street."
"Maybe that's this terminal's power
source?"
"I believe that's our only lead for now.
Let's return to Central Street."
"Hey, ain't this another one o' them
terminals Oracle's been hacking?"
"This one's screen is blank, though.
Could it be turned off?"
"We powered something earlier.
Was it not this terminal?"
"No, that went here—it's just not
enough juice."
"Based on the power consumption,
I'd say this thing uses three separate
sources."
"THREE power sources!? The electric
bill for this terminal alone must be
horrifying..."
"There have to be more of those
generators somewhere nearby. Let's
go back to Central Street and look."
"Hmm... Looks like all the power from
those generators we turned on is
ending here."
"Oh hey, it's another one of those
terminals you've been hacking,
Oracle."
"Huh? It took three whole generators
to power this one lil' thing?"
"I know what you mean, that seems
rather wasteful. Perhaps something
else beyond here is also powered up."
"Well, I'm still glad we were able to
find them all."
"Indeed—otherwise, we would've had
to turn back."
"Your instincts continue to serve you
well, Joker."
"All right then! Good luck with the
hacking, Oracle!"
"Hey! Isn't that one of those power
generators?"
"Good thing we found it. Shall we
switch it on now?"
"Do you think this properly powered
the terminal?"
Uhhh... this isn't gonna cut it.
"Considering the output levels I'm
seeing here, we're gonna need to
turn on two more."
"What!? How much power's that
thing use!?"
"Looks like we have to poke around
and find some more generators."
"Power source sighted. We should
turn it on."
That's the second generator so far.
"Just one more to go, right? Let's
keep it up!"
There's a generator!
"We've activated three generators.
Is that sufficient, Oracle?"
"Yep, we have the power! Let's get
back to that terminal!"
"The terminal really is on now, thank
goodness."
Finally we can get going—
"Not just yet. Oracle still has to hack
into it."
"Welp, it's hacking time! Ready to
watch my back?"
"Mission complete! We've nearly
reached Bunkamachi."
"So, this is the final Prison Keep."
"The walls're just as high as the
others..."
"I suspect the gate is closed just as
with the others. How will we
breach the keep?"
"Perhaps we can leap over there from
another rooftop? Let's try gaining
some elevation."
"This appears to be the main
entrance."
Locked—no surprise there...
"Nope. I guess we'll have to drop in
from above, huh?"
"Whoa, check the view!"
"This offers a pretty good view of the
area."
"Now, to find a point of entry..."
Hey! There!
"That string of flags leads all the way
to the Keep. Think we could slide
down it to get over there?"
"Hmmm, it doesn't look taut enough
for us to use like that."
"What if we gave the Ferris wheel
a spin? Would that tighten it up?"
"You know, that could work. Let's
head over there and check it out."
"Who are you? What are you doing
here!?"
"Aw crap, we're busted!"
"Careful! That one's stronger than the
others!"
"This must be the terminal for the
Ferris wheel. Can you power it up,
Oracle?"
"We don't have to go huntin' for more
generators, do we?"
"Nope, looks like we're good here.
It's already juiced up for us!"
"Perhaps the Ferris wheel's connected
to the same generators?"
"Then everything turned out great
for us! Can you get it working,
Oracle?"
Aaallriiight! Ferris wheel: activate!
Oooh.
You did it!
Now we can enter the Prison Keep.
Yes! Time for our grand entrance!
Wha— What are you doing here!?
"We've come to relieve you of your
duties!"
Take him down and the core is ours!
Yes! Mission complete!
So the last core is... a CD?
"Oh, I recognize that album. Its songs
are in a lot of commercials nowadays."
"That's Alice's biggest album, the one
that's been at the top of the charts
for weeks now..."
"So, 'zat mean it's a scam? Did she
only blow up 'cause she changed
so many hearts?"
......
"That should be the last of the Jail's
power sources."
"Correct—the searchlights should
be deactivated now."
"Finally, we can enter Alice's castle.
Shall we?"
"Yes. We need to stop her as soon as
possible."
"Let's return to the Crossing so we can
head to the castle!"
"Sitrep, everyone!"
"We're at the searchlights—just
waitin' on the signal!"
No Shadows in sight on our end.
"Looks like the diversion is working,
all thanks to Joker!"
"It's all up to you now, Oracle."
"I've got this. Mona, take over
navigation for me!"
Gotcha! Good luck hacking!
"Joker, more Shadows incoming!"
"Watch out, reinforcements are here!"
How's that wall comin'? Ya done yet?
Hang on! I'm working on it!
"All these Shadows flooding the
Shibuya streets... That's certainly
no everyday sight."
"Now I'm imagining it happening in
the real world... Scary."
"Aaaaaaaaaand, as the cherry on top:"
"Mweheheh... Enjoy your Oracle
Virus Parfait, chumps!"
Thank goodness we made it in time!
"That couldn'ta gone better, Joker!"
Now the real fight begins!
"Let's mop up the rest of these Shadows
so we can get to 705!"
"Enemy Shadows defeated! Nice,
now nothing stands in our way!"
"I've returned from my diversion.
The plan appears to have been a
success."
"Hey, great hustle out there, Sophie!
Now all we hafta do is storm the
castle!"
Nooo! Not that way!
The searchlights are off now!
"Looks like the plan worked. Time to
breach the enemy stronghold."
"I'm picking up some Shadows...
Looks like a few guards stuck
around."
"Add 'em to the KO count so we can
move on!"
"The searchlights in the area ahead
are still active."
"Those'll be a breeze for Joker. He can
slip right past 'em!"
"So you're the ones defiling this
kingdom..."
"You will go no further. Once you are
dead, Her Majesty can be at ease!"
"This one's tough! Careful, guys!"
All Shadows defeated!
"The barrier's down, too—let's move
out while we still can!"
All right! We're in!
"I'm picking up that Treasure-like
smell right above us, in the throne
room. Let's go!"
"Oof, it's locked..."
"Try finding a mechanism somewhere
here."
"We've found the intruders!
Capture them!"
Shoot! Incoming!
How the heck did we get caught?
"It must have something to do with
the switches in the busts... Maybe
there's a correct order?"
"Try focusing—look for any sort of
clue how to approach this."
"Hey, that did it! Good sleuthing,
Joker."
Let's get on up.
Oh... The stairwell...
This is quite the climb...
"If this is anything like the 705 in the
real world, there'll be an elevator
somewhere."
Maybe check for one here too?
Intruders! Get them!
"How dare you filth defy Her
Majesty!?"
Incoming! We're surrounded!
"What the hell? How'd we get
jumped!?"
"Ugh, they don't give up!"
"The elevator's on its way! Just hang
in there!"
All right! Now take the elevator!
More Shadows? But how!?
There's no escape!
"We've found the intruders! Call for
backup!"
"We made it! Hurry, get out!"
"That was a pretty rough ride!
Everyone holding up?"
"They really aren't messing around
with us anymore."
"We've gone quite a ways up
already—how much further
to the top?"
"There should be a stairwell on
the other side of that door..."
"Invasive filth! You'll never reach the
royal hall!"
"The cost of defying Her Majesty is
your heads!"
"Incoming! The exploring can wait
until we know it's safe!"
"They've got serious numbers...
Wanna try out that party popper?"
"Finally, it's over..."
Hell yeah! Let's keep on rollin'!
"Aw, what!? Now THIS door won't
open!"
But this door leads to the stairwell...
Hmm?
"Maybe we should check outside?
Could be worthwhile."
Oh! How about THIS way?
Let's see where they take us.
"So, they escaped, did they?"
Joker! The window!
"Aaagh! Please forgive me, Your
Majesty!"
"I TOLD you to capture them...
Do you require punishment?"
Yeeeeek!
"Ugh, wouldn't want to be on the receiving end
of that..."
"Oh, now you pity whoever's gettin' whipped..."
"That Treasure-like smell isn't far now.
Let's get to the roof."
"Can't you get it through your thick
skull? No one wants you around."
"Oh, shit! What the hell is goin' on!?
This thing just flipped out outta
nowhere!"
"The room's also changed. Are these...
prison cells?"
No time—here it comes!
"Look sharp, folks!"
"Aren't you supposed to be all down
in the dumps? What're you doing
batting your lashes at some guy?"
What is WITH this thing!?
"I don't know, but... whatever that
thing is, it's horrible!"
"What the hell's up with this room,
too!? Ain't it supposed to have the
birdcage key in it? Not THIS!?"
"The key is most assuredly here.
It must be hidden somewhere
within the cell."
"We're not exactly fit to search for it
now—focus on the enemy first!"
"Huh? Oh, you're here? You're so
bland I didn't even notice you,
hahaha!"
"Is this stuff... from Alice's past? Did
she really go through all this?"
"There were some truly terrible things
said in the classroom as well..."
"I believe we've seen why Alice strove
so far to wipe the records of her time
at school..."
"We should avoid wasting energy on
our attacks. Let's read the enemy's
movements and respond in kind!"
I lost the reading! Where'd it go!?
"This thing can teleport!? Watch out
for sneak attacks, everyone!"
"Your face really pisses me off. Why
won't you just go off and die for us
already?"
"Those wind-up attacks look like
they'll really hurt! Better stay
sharp!"
"Ahahah, that's so good! You think a
guy would actually be into someone
like YOU? Get real!"
"Whoa! This thing's really puttin' up
a fight!"
"Don't get too close! Keep a safe
distance!"
*gasp* Look out!
"It's warpin' all over the place now!
Quit cheatin', dammit!"
"I heard you actually confessed your
feelings to him? Gross. SO FUCKING
GROSS!"
"Are you just, like, obsessed with guys
now or something? It's not like you'd
ever make a good couple."
"In fact, I think I'll take him off your
hands for you! Ahahahahaha!"
"""Take him""? So, all of this bullying
was over some affairs of the heart."
"What a bunch of bullies! They were
just too mean to Alice!"
"The enemy's getting weaker! Put that
bully in its place!"
Hell yeah! That did it!
Hang on—something's up...
"Look! The chain goes all the way to
the top!"
"Perhaps it fell when we opened the
lock."
"Climbing this should give us a straight
shot to the birdcage of Desires."
"We'll enter through here after we
send the calling card."
"What in the... She turned into some
kinda rabbit!"
So this really is Alice in Wonderland...
"Oh my, I'm late for a very important
date."
"Come along, come along! I have such
wonders to show you!"
What wonders?
"Ignore her, Sophie. She just wants to
torture us or something."
"Alice... I'm gonna make you see the
light!"
"Aw, you Phantom Thieves seem like
best buds. Any of you happen to be
dating?"
"Wha— How would that be any of
your business!?"
"*giggle* I wonder who you've got
your eye on, Takamaki-san?"
"Personally, I've got a thing for
Joker! I'm gonna take your heart!"
"Dude, she is freaky! You better
watch out, Joker!"
"Alice, why are you doing this!?
You've hurt so many people!"
Huh? Don't blame me.
"It's not my fault everyone's in love
with me."
"What can I do if they say they only
have eyes for me? *giggle*"
"What? No one who's saying that
means it—you're just manipulating
them!"
"Oh? So you know about all that, huh?
I never would have guessed you were
a phantom thief, Takamaki-san."
"Who will change whose heart in the
end? Oh, I just can't wait to find out!"
"She's tough... See any weaknesses
yet, Oracle?"
"One sec, analyzing..."
"She is weak to... [1B]M0~2~Fire!
Burn that smirk right off her face!"
"It burns! You must really wanna piss
me off."
"Weakness to [1B]M0~2~Fire
confirmed! Let's turn up the heat!"
"Looks like she's weak to
[1B]M0~5~Wind! Got any wind
to send her way?"
"Looks like I'm up to bat! I'll take care
of this!"
Cut it ouuut! You'll ruin my hair!
"[1B]M0~5~Wind is doing the
trick! Keep on blowin'
her away!"
"That brainwashing is serious...
Be careful, everyone!"
Think we could use that pole?
"We can wait for Alice to enter range
then utilize a spin attack for massive
damage."
"Right, pay attention to your timing
and then let her have it!"
"Hey, check out the party popper!"
"That's a good idea. With proper aim,
we could do some major damage."
"Raining confetti upon the stage...
That would be quite pleasing,
aesthetically."
"You'll have your chance when Alice
goes for the pole. That's when you
blast her!"
"Owww! Hey, what the hell!?"
"Ah, so that is how those function."
"Only here! You're not supposed to
aim them at people!"
Ow... What the hell was that!?
Now! Get her!
"Yes! She's getting weaker. Take her
down!"
"Why are you being like this? I was
finally able to find some happiness..."
"Are you here to take everything
I have? Just like she did?"
JUST TRY ME!
"Something's changed... Stay on
guard!"
"Whoa, holy shit!"
Why's she so fast now!? Sheesh!
It's time to take you all to school!
"She refuses to give up... Alice, what
made you like this?"
"You'd never get it, Takamaki-san."
"I've been treated like shit all my life!
I had everything taken from me!
You don't know what that's like!"
"The further up the social ladder,
the shittier they were to me!"
"Even if they saw someone getting
tortured, they'd just smile and keep
on walking like I didn't matter!"
"How could trash like that NOT
deserve it?"
"And I'll show you that you're trash
too."
"Once I've got a man in my grasp,
there's no letting go. I'll turn him on
you, then you'll learn true despair..."
"Soon I will be loved by all the men
in the world!"
"Ngh! Why are you... I'm not doing
anything wrong!"
"Alice is getting weaker! Just one
more big push—keep it up, guys!"
"All those girls looking down on me...
They'll see! They'll see how every
man is mine!"
"Is that really what you want, Alice?
Don't be stupid!"
"I remember your real answer. You
have to remember too, Alice!"
Tell me! What do you REALLY want!?
I...
This... can't be...
Did we do it!?
"Hmm, we still can't see what's
going on inside."
"We'll just have to get even higher.
Let's see, where's the tallest building
around here?"
"Bingo! Let's try getting to that one's
roof!"
"Roger that, changing destination..."
"All right—I think we can make it up
there if we follow those balloons!"
"So we can use those to cross the
rooftops? Great! Let's keep our
eyes open for any balloons."
"This looks like some
sort of container..."
"Gah, this place is fulla garbage...
Where are we, anyways?"
"I don't know, but we should look
for an exit."
"Ooh, look! The gate's open!"
"Is it because we took the core?
Whatever the case, we can get back
without having to go underground."
"Right! Let's stroll on through and
find the next keep!"
"I don't think randomly messing
with them is gonna work! There's
gotta be some kind of clue..."
"We Phantom Thieves have expert
eyes—they'll get us to the bottom
of this!"
"They're still powered, despite our
taking all the cores?"
"These aren't the ones we turned off.
Those're the ones up where we
climbed, over there."
"Ah yes, the elevated area with the
turret. Well, let's be on our way."
.....?
"There's a switch.
Should I use it...?"
Go for it
Back away slowly

"This statue... Is that supposed to be
Natsume?"
What a creep!
"It won't budge. I don't think we'll
be opening this any time soon."
"There's something written there.
""The way forward will reveal itself
to he who proves his worth."""
"Then, we'll likely need to obtain 
something to help us do that..."
"It doesn't look like we have much
choice. Let's see if there's another
path we can take."
"""The way forward will reveal itself to he who
proves his worth."""
"This way's no good. We'll have to
try something else."
"Dude, an overlord's castle, though?
This is actually kinda sick!"
"Pipe down, Skull. We're on enemy
turf, remember?"
"Oh, yeah... Sorry."
"*sigh* First things first, let's get an
idea of our surroundings."
"Hold up! We got searchlights ahead.
Security here's pretty tight."
"It appears the gate is closed as well. We
won't be getting in this way."
"In that case, let us play true to phantom thief
form and sneak in through the back."
"We have no further business here.
Our job now is to find this ""proof""
needed to enter."
Huh!? We're back at the entrance!?
Looks like you're sent back here if you get caught by the searchlights.
"Just what I'd expect from the ""supreme overlord""
type. Those guys always get the most jank, OP
abilities."
Hrgh... This guy's really starting to piss me off.
"It seems foolish to try getting in through the
front. Let's try going around the back."
"It says ""One must offer sun and rain""..."
Hm? We got Shadows! Heads up!
"That building just screams
""suspicious."" Think that's
our ""shrine of sun""?"
"If it is, then perhaps the orb
is inside. Let's take a closer
look, Joker."
"Whoa, where are you going? Aren't 
we gonna check out the shrine?"
"Wha—!? The lights went off! Wait, is
that a Shadow!?"
"It's just as the novel said. The orb is a
symbol of the sun. Remove it, and the
light fades."
"Once that happens, warriors will
appear to prevent its theft."
Then that means...
"Yes, this seems par for the course."
Why didn't you tell us this earlier!?
Phew. That was a close one.
"Next time, tell us about the
gaggle of enemies BEFORE
we get jumped, Inari."
"My apologies, I knew I had
forgotten something."
"Anyways, we've got the sun we
need. All that's left is to find the
rain."
"It said something about a ""land of
rain,"" right? Let's keep looking."
"Ooh, you lowered the bridge. That'll
help us get around easier."
"There's a bridge here, but we
obviously can't cross it like this."
"Nothing we can do now. Let's try a
different path."
I see... Is this what they call rain?
"It just started pouring all of a sudden.
Maybe this is the place we're looking
for..."
"It certainly matches the ""land of rain""
moniker. No doubt the orb is
somewhere nearby."
"Whoa, what's that!?"
"Sure looks suspicious... Think that's
our target?"
"It could be a trap. But we don't have
any other choice. Don't let your
guard down."
"Hm!? I'm sensing what feels like
treasure..."
There!
Is that jewel... alive?
It's a Treasure Demon! Get it before it escapes!
"It's trying to get away! After it, Joker!"
"Dang, this thing is tough!"
"Looks like [1B]M0~3~Ice is effective!
Strike its weakness and force it
to come out!"
What was that?
"They're a rare type of Shadow we sometimes see
in the Metaverse."
"We call them Treasure Demons.
Taking one down can net you all
kinds of big rewards."
"I see. I'll be sure to remember these 
Treasure Demons."
"So if we see one, we should try to
defeat it like the one just now?"
"Right. They're quick to run away, 
though, so you gotta be careful."
The door is closed.
"So we can't get inside? I don't see a
keyhole anywhere either..."
"Let's take a look around. There might
be another way in."
Searchlights! Don't get spotted now!
...So it was here after all.
"We've got both the sun and the rain.
Let's get back over to the tower."
"Oh, hey. Did the rain stop?"
"Oh, yeah, guess so. It's prolly 'cause we took that orb, huh?"
"Hey, wait! This place is treatin' us like a party of RPG heroes, right?"
"How 'bout we decide each other's job 
classes? Y'know, like Warrior and
Priest and stuff!"
"Well, Joker's definitely the Hero.
Queen's the Martial Artist. I guess
Mona would be the Mage."
What about me?
"You're the Jester, Skull. Done deal."
"The Jeste— Wait, why!?"
"Does that mean my job would be the
Company Manager?"
"...I don't think that's what they're
talking about."
"Okay, let's try putting the orbs where
they need to go."
"Ooh, it worked!"
"So the proof is in here. Let's have a
look inside."
"Haha... Well done, chosen heroes...
I admit defeat."
"I will open the door for you... I wish
you luck on the rest of your journey."
Farewell... My darling...
"Ugh, he's doing one of those
sentimental plot thread things..."
"Come on, let's get that proof!"
"Whoa! The door just up and opened
for no reason!"
"Perhaps it's because we proved we're 
worthy of passage."
Hm? What's that?
It looks like some kinda light...
There's something above us.
Ugh! What the heck is that!?
"So that's how the enemy knew we
were here?"
"Joker, shoot that thing before it
spots us!"
"This door won't open... Maybe we're
missing something."
Ooh. Looks like we've found another orb.
"With how things have been going,
we'll probably use this to open some
kind of door."
"A safe assessment, to say the least.
Indeed, this is most likely one of
the novel's ""tri-color orbs."""
"It says we're to gather the red, blue,
and yellow orbs in order to open the
sealed doors."
"All right, then! Let's look for a door
we can open with this."
Wait! The enemy is closing in!
"Oh, it's open!"
But there's even more of those doors.
"Bet these are gonna need orbs too, huh?
C'mon, let's take a look around."
There's an orb. Let us claim it for ourselves.
"Not so fast, heroes! That orb is ours!"
"Wah, we got Shadows! Take 'em out, guys!"
So now we have a blue orb.
"Which means we should be able to
open the blue door. Let's head back."
"Nice, it opened! So all that's left is the yellow
orb, right?"
"This doesn't look like the right door.
Try the other one."
Filthy intruders... You will not take the orb!
"This is the last orb, guys! You can do it!"
"We've opened all the doors. Now to
enter the Prison Keep."
"All right, let's move, double time!"
Maaade it!
"Looks like this way's blocked too. Should
be able to hack our way through, though."
You guys ready? I'll need you to watch my back!
All right! We're in business!
"Okay. Now we just need to climb
the tower! Race you to the top!"
"It looks like this core is a... trophy? It says
""Soukaisha Awards."""
"Hmph. Dude probably got this by cheating,
too."
"But look at this date... This was definitely before
people's hearts started to change."
So... He won this on his own?
"Hmm... I don't buy it. You can't win an award
just by ripping people off."
"Regardless, that's two pieces of proof we've
obtained."
"That's just one left. Where haven't we checked
yet?"
"There was that door back when we first
entered. Maybe we should look there."
"We did score another piece of proof, so maybe
it'll open now. Let's head back."
"Yo, is this it? The gate was closed,
but now it's wide open."
Okaaay! One last piece of proof!
"I can see the Prison Keep, but the entrance is
closed."
"Don't think we're getting in that way. Did the
book have any other hints, Fox?"
"In the story, the heroes had to walk across an
invisible floor to get inside."
"An invisible floor... How do we find something
we can't see?"
"We'll just have to look really carefully. Maybe
something'll turn up."
"Joker, try to focus and see if you can't find an invisible floor around here."
"Ooh, check out those swords...
Calling out to your inner
edgelord, aren't they?"
"Bet it'd be pretty sweet if you
flung them at the enemy!
Shhhwing!"
"Whoa, it's actually invisible!"
"I-Is this safe? We're not going to fall, are we?"
"Nope, we should be good!
Let's take these things all
the way to the Keep!"
Invisible floors... How interesting.
Be careful n-not to fall...
"Nngh, my knees won't stop shaking..."
"Blerrrgh... So... It seems it's the end for me as well. Come visit me in the afterlife, won't you, beautiful?"
In your dreams!
That takes care of old man ogles-a-lot. Now we just need to nab the proof!
"All right, let's head to the top!"
"""The brave heroes approach their foe..."" 
Who goes there? Who dares disturb my 
slumber?"
Oh crap! We got another one!
And what's up with the narrating?
"Silence, whelps! I am his excellency the
Overlord's retainer, Doramu!"
"My liege's castle lies just beyond. Lowly
humans such as yourselves have no place
in its hallowed halls!"
"Your end is at hand! Prepare yourselves,
you foolish, repulsive-looking creatures!"
He thinks we're repulsive...
"News flash, you look just like us."
......
Your end is at hand!
"Yo, he straight up ignored us!"
"Urgh... To be defeated by such utterly
grotesque beings..."
"Dude, you were one of us like two seconds ago!"
"You were a fierce opponent, Overlord's retainer."
"*chuckle* Go on, then, chosen heroes... But be warned... My master... is all-powerful. Blerrrgh..."
"Okay, we've made it inside. Let's keep up the pace."
There should be a path forward somewhere around here. Keep your eyes peeled.
How far along are we now?
We're only about halfway up. It's gonna be a while before we get to the top.
Guess we'll wanna keep an eye on our health and stuff.
W-What!? Something's shooting up from the floor!
It's a trap! Look out!
Well... there's no turning back now. Let's double down and keep moving forward!
"We're almost to the top floor. Just a little bit further, guys!"
"Write all you want, a talentless hack
like you is hopeless, hopeless,
HOPELESS!"
"This is the same thing we saw in
Shibuya!"
"Careful! It's using different weapons
from last time!"
"I might not like that Natsume guy,
but... It's these assholes who were
usin' him the whole time, right?"
"Yeah... I feel kind of sorry for him.
They only chose him for who he was,
not what he wrote."
"Authors are just chips in a bigger
game! They exist solely for us to win!"
"From what I can tell, his editor was a
real scumbag."
"I know his pain perhaps more than
anyone... For that reason, I refuse to
let this go on any longer."
"Hey, cheer up. You might be a shit
writer, but at least you've got a knack
for stringing yourself along! Hahaha!"
It's fast... Be careful not to get caught up in its attacks!
Okay! Taking evasive action.
"It's working! Keep it up, guys!"
"Even worthless trash like yours can
sell. And as long as there's a buyer,
I'll be there to bleed you dry!"
"A sword is nothing if you lack the
conviction to swing it! Such a dull
blade is worthless against me!"
"Y'know, I said I was in this for the money, but holy hell, reading through this shit is tortuuure!"
"He's going for a combo attack. Don't
let him ram you!"
"I don't care who's holding the pen!
If your face sells, that's all I'll ever
need!"
"Whoa, it's coming after us!"
"Don't let your guard down after that
first attack! Stand your ground and
wait till he stops!"
"He can't seriously be proud of
submitting this trash, can he?"
"Whoa, shit! That last attack was crazy
fast!"
"But on the other hand, it leaves him
wide open. Dodge the attack then hit
him with everything you've got!"
"You'd better cling to that name of
yours! Way I see it, that's all you'll
ever have!"
"It's warping around using sneak
attacks... Is this what they call a
""ninja""!?"
"Not exactly! Last time I checked,
ninjas don't use giant machetes!"
"You're my ticket to the bigtime, eh,
""Mr. Natsume""? Ahahahahahaha!"
You did it! The warden's down for the count!
"Whoa, check out that statue that totally ate it!
And hey, doesn't that remind you of how we
got to the top in Shibuya? Ready for round two?"
"Great! Looks like the Desires
materialized!"
"Go get 'em, guys!"
"You ignorant whelps dare to challenge the
great Overlord himself!? Imbeciles! I will
feast upon your bones!"
Holy crap! A dragon!
"Be careful, guys! This one's really tough!"
"Hahahaha! Pathetic humans! Gaze
upon my magnificence!"
"I, the Prince of Nightmares, carry the 
blood of dragons in my veins! No 
mere human could ever defeat me!"
"Lay down your weapons and submit!
Do so, and your lives will be spared!"
"Like we'd ever join you? Thanks, but
no thanks!"
"Besides, the evil Overlord's destined
to get his ass beat! That's fantasy rule
number 1, dude!"
"Ango Natsume, you are a shameful 
despot steeped in vanity. Today, 
your rule comes to an end!"
"He's got the advantage while he's in
the air! Oracle, is there anything
we can do!?"
"Over there! Those swords stuck in the
ground! Use those to turn him into a
pincushion!"
"Dammit, I can't reach him! Get down
here and fight us, you smug bastard!"
"It looks like we'll have to hit him
from somewhere up high!"
"He's landed! Now's your chance
to attack!"
You're doin' good! Keep it up!
"Whoa, since when could he do
that!?"
His tail is a pen...?
"Watch out! He's trying to blind us
with his ink!"
Whoa! I can't see!
Nooo! This is so gross!
Huh? I feel weaker somehow...
Wha!? He's totally debuffed us!
"Foolish humans. The least I can do
is grant you a peaceful death."
"Witness as I pen the legends of the
great Overlord!"
"Hey, he's writing something!"
"Is he building up energy!? Crap, 
you've gotta stop that pen of his!"
"Hahahaha! I've done it! No greater 
masterpiece has ever been written!"
"Ngh... You'd dare to deny my
genius? Such a sin is unforgivable!"
"Hmph, you're not getting your
way as long as we're around!"
"I was born of nightmares blacker
and darker than darkness itself!
Watch as I unleash hell!"
"Whoa, he's powered up like crazy!
He must be getting serious!"
"We gotta slow his momentum! Can
you target his weakness and knock
him down?"
"Gyah! D-Damn it... You made me
lose my edge!"
"His buff's gone! Time to put the
hurt on him!"
Kgh... Blasted little rats!
"Those with talent are always being dragged
down by those without. How can you be so
ignorant!?"
"Villain, you have no right to say
such a thing!"
"W-What? Are you suggesting I have
no talent!?"
"And what talent can you claim to
possess? Stealing others' work for
your own selfish interests?"
"You've cast away both your soul
and your pride... You've no place
calling yourself a writer!"
"Dammit... Dammit, dammit,
dammit!"
"You're just like them! You're just
like those bastards who denied
me!"
"You think you're better than me!?
I'll show you how wrong you are!"
Hahaha! How was that!?
"If you thought that was Agidyne
just now, think again... It was Agi!"
"Oh boy... I've definitely heard that
line before!"
"He's running out of steam!
Stay on him, guys!"
"Such power... Is this the Overlord's
true strength!?"
"We need to avoid taking a direct
hit at all costs!"
"Urgh... My hands are too numb to
write. How dare you employ such
a cheap trick!"
"Ooh, looks like [1B]M0~3~Ice is the way
to go. We'll see how tough he is
once we turn him into an ice pop!"
"Gah! Ergh, why you little... Why
would the gods favor you over
me!?"
"Man, he's really committed to this
role, isn't he? Either way, it looks like
he's weak to [1B]M0~8~Bless attacks!"
"Guh... These swords were once
wielded by past heroes! Even in
death, they continue to defy me!"
"Yo, what the hell's he talkin' about?"
"It seems he's added some 
backstory. That said, those swords
work quite well against him."
"Urrrgh... I-Impossible... You're
capable of casting Absolute Zero!?"
"Um... That means it worked, right?"
"Yeah... looks like it. We should
probably keep using them, huh?"
"Aaah! My armor! The hell are 
you— I mean... Keep your filthy
hands off me!"
"So even that golden coat of yours
was a sham. You're a fraud to the
very core... How pitiful."
"Seems everything's finally been 
revealed. Time to finish him off!"
"Gah...! This can't be... The great
Overlord... Defeated..."
Where the hell'd those guys come from!?
"There weren't any signs of the enemy before...
Is there some kind of trap in place?"
"Careful, Joker. We've got eyes on us..."
"Watch your surroundings! You'll prolly see
something if you look hard enough!"
...Hm?
"There's a checkpoint nearby, but... it looks like
the warp function isn't working."
"Is this the work of that Fearsome Four guy too?
Guess he really doesn't plan on letting us leave."
"...So we're trapped here. Still, there's no need to
panic."
"If he's the reason it's not working, then all we
have to do is get him out of the picture."
"So now that we've defeated Do... Domu? Do you
think we can use the checkpoints again?"
Oh? Ooh! They're working again!
"And there's one nearby, too. Perfect! Now we
can head back to the real world and stock up on
supplies and stuff if we need."
"I wouldn't be surprised if something like this
happened again. It might be a good idea to prep
some more, just to be on the safe side."
"Even so, we'll want to be ready in the event we're
unable to return to the real world right away."
"Make sure to switch out party members so no
one ends up overdoing it."

"So this is what snow is like...
Hehe, it's all white and crunchy."
"Just don't roll around in it, Sophie.
You blend in so much, we might lose
ya."
What lies beyond that road?
"I believe it was the clock tower,
back in the real world."
"Looks real suspicious to me.
Let's go check it out!"
"Too cold... Can't move...
Can't I just wait here?"
"Absolutely not. What if Shadows
were to ambush you?"
"Be strong, Oracle."
Brr... Fine...
"Oh, it's a Prison Keep!"
"Based on the past few Jails, we should
find something here that'll help us
move forward."
Nice! The gate's open!
"Don't you feel like something's
off, though?"
"Hmm... Not picking up any Shadows
on the radar."
"Even so, we shouldn't let our guard
down. Anything could happen."
"This snowstorm's friggin' insane!
Can't see a thing out here."
"Any further exposure might put our
health at risk. We need to get out of
here now."
Watch out! Shadows incoming!
Please... lemme hibernate...
"No way! You'd freeze to death in this
cold!"
"Hang in there, Oracle. We're almost
at our destination."
"Man, it's so nice and toasty... I really
don't wanna move."
"I could build an igloo here...
*yawn* Getting the sleepies..."
"Stay vigilant, you two."
"Too bad we can't rest here for long.
At least we can generate some body
heat if we start moving around."
"Good idea. Let's get huffin' and
puffin', people!"
"I think I can hack this place open.
That'll attract Shadows, so you'll
need to clean 'em up!"
Only three more to go.
Two more left.
We're on our last one!
"Oh look, the snowstorm stopped."
"Perhaps the heaters have stopped it
for good."
"That must be why the enemies
were guarding them."
"Looks like they're pretty handy.
Let's keep them in mind in case
we run into any more snowy issues."
"Aah!? H-How'd you make it through
the snowstorm unscathed!?"
"So this is the goon behind that
snowy mess..."
"Ohhh, I'll get punished for sure
if she finds out I goofed up..."
"Sorry, but you're all gonna die
right here!"
Look!
"The ice wall is gone, just as we
thought!"
"We can move on to the next
Prison Keep now. Let's go."
There it is... the Prison Keep.
"It's our second one.
Let's do this!"
"Be careful, we're trapped in!"
"It looks like we can descend from
here... although there are Shadows
in the way."
"It's a steep slope covered with snow.
The danger is there regardless."
"Hey, isn't that a snowboard over
there? Why don't we use that
to cruise down?"
"Ooh, lemme do a little
technomancy on it!"
"It's all yours, Oracle."
We'll protect you!
Another snowstorm!?
"There are Shadows creeping out
here, too. Hope we'll be okay."
"There's another heater nearby.
Maybe you should get rid of the
snowstorm first!"
"We defeated the enemy, but we
won't last long in this snowstorm.
Let's find ourselves a heater."
"We've eliminated all obstacles.
Let us proceed to the tower."
"All right, let's take what we
came for!"
"Yay, we got a core! Why's it a
flower?"
"Wasn't she telling off that one staff
member who let that flower wither?"
"I wonder if it's related to what she
said earlier..."
"How she wanted to make Sapporo a
beautiful destination for all."
"While I certainly understand her
passion, sacrificing her own people
to do it is completely unacceptable."
...Yes. I agree.
"At any rate, we retrieved the core.
Let's head back to Odori Park."
"You, thief! Return what you stole
at once!"
"You have no idea what kind of
torture awaits us if the Monarch
finds out..."
"Sorry to hear that, but there's no
turning back!"
Look! The ice wall disappeared!
"That appears to be the final
Prison Keep."
"The Prison Keep is there, but..."
"It's the same ice barrier we
encountered at Odori Park.
We can't get through like this."
"But the core is just ahead, right?
What do we do?"
How about up there?
"We may be able to drop in from
above, as long as we're willing
to climb."
"Nice thinking, Inari! Then
let's head over there!"
"Hey, don't you think we'd get there
much easier if we slid down?"
"Good idea. You're sharp, Panther."
"Witness as we gallantly soar down
these slopes to safety! This may just
be the inspiration I need."
You consider this inspiring?
"Woohoo! Shred the gnar, baby!"
"Ahh, I love the feeling of wind in
my hair!"
"Hey, careful! Look ahead!"
I really like the motion. Shooooom!
"Shadows! Defeat them and move
on!"
"As I suspected, it seems we can
enter from here."
"All right, let's do this thing!"
Hey! Where'd you come from!?
"The enemy's panicking! Get
rid of them!"
"All taken care of. Now let's
get to that core!"
"All right, this is the third core."
Is this... a badge?
"It's the Sapporo Central mayor's
insignia: a simple yet effective
symbol of power."
"Oh, look!"
"The ice wall is gone. We can
finally make some progress
now."
"The Monarch's gonna punish us
because of you! You think you
can just do whatever you want!?"
"Save that line for your Monarch.
Better yet, we'll tell her—once we
take you all out!"
All obstacles have been eliminated.
"Finally... I was getting pretty
worn-out there."
"We should consider our health.
Why don't we head back and
prepare?"
"Gah, it's freezing! Bet I'll catch a cold
any minute!"
"It did go from summer to winter
pretty quickly, didn't it?"
I miss being warm already.
"Then tonight, we indulge in miso
ramen—with extra chashu."
That's Mari-san's castle...
"Its appearance is rather striking...
The closer we get, the more vivid
its detail."
"Detail aside, we can't get in again."
"Then let's search for another
entrance."
"Oh, can we get in from up there?"
"How're we gonna reach it, though?
There anything we can use like a
platform?"
All right. Infiltration successful.
Shadows spotted ahead. Be careful.
Wow... It's beautiful.
Yes. Such a magnificent design.
"This is no time to be distracted by
architecture! There are enemies
here!"
"Hyodo should be up ahead... but
there's a problem."
The door is frozen.
"All right Skull, you're up."
"Heck no, I don't want my hands
gettin' stuck!"
"Guess that's not an option, then. 
Let's find another way."
Shadows! Wipe 'em out!
"Hey, do you think we could reach
the outside from that window?"
"Ah, if we climb out through there,
we may be able to ascend the outer
wall."
"Damn, it's ass-bitin' cold!"
"The wind is strong, too..."
"Careful not to fall, everyone."
"Uhh... Shouldn't you be
threatening us by now?"
"I don't think they're here to mess
around! Be ready for a challenge!"
"How can you blame a peon like me?
We don't get paid enough for this!"
"This world revolves around money...
Money talks, bullshit walks, Mayor!"
"Bastard... So he threatened the
mayor, is that it!?"
"I had no idea Mari-san went
through something like this...
Something so awful."
"Think later, act now! We've got a
real fight on our hands here!"
"You're guilty too, right, Mayor?"
"She died because you gave your
approval! Hahahahaha!"
"This guy's atrocious, placing all the
blame on the mayor!"
"We're here to set Mari-san right.
Listening to thugs like you is a waste
of our precious time!"
"The birdcage should be open once
we beat him. Everyone, do your best!"
It's useless no matter what you do!
"You should've just resigned and
disappeared!"
"Man, he's tough. Go down already,
dammit!"
No one likes a pushy politician.
"Why single me out? If I'm corrupt,
then so is everyone around me!"
"He's getting weaker! Come on,
everyone!"
"Prepare yourself! I will cleave
right through your shield!"
"Report it if you want. I'll take
the mayor down with me!"
"He's up to something! Can
anybody stop him!?"
"The defense of the nearby Shadows
has gone way up! Be tactical!"
"It's too late to change anything. The
death of a sweet little girl... So tragic!"
"Look, he's trying to heal his allies!
Stop him in his tracks!"
"Dammit! He healed the other
Shadows!"
"Argh, what a pain in the ass!"
"Now we're accomplices.
Let's try to get along."
"Way to stick it to 'em!
Keep punching away!"
"You want to stay mayor that
badly? What a greedy woman
you are!"
"He's attacking with the shield,
too! Watch out, everyone!"
"Mari-san, what you're doing is
wrong. So we'll be taking those
Desires back!"
"Shut your prissy little mouth!
What would you know!?"
"I will consume all who oppose me,
no matter who they are!"
"Whoa, what's with all the food!?
I... kinda want some."
Now's not the time to stuff your face! Here she comes!
"That chandelier...
Maybe we can use it as a weapon."
"It should deal considerable damage
if we drop it on her. If only there was
a way to halt her movement..."
"Why, damn you!? Why do you insist
on standing in my way!?"
"Her attack power's getting stronger!
This doesn't look good, guys!"
"She's fully consumed with rage...
Everyone, keep your guard up!"
"Her mind is totally unstable!
We could deal massive damage
with [1B]M0~6~Psychokinesis attacks!"
"Did she just eat one of us!?
Somebody help!"
"Knocking her down should force her
to spit 'em out! Aim for the body!"
"It's freezing! Why's there a
blizzard in here!?"
"I was able to hack the heater to the
northwest! Go turn it on before we
all freeze!"
"One heater hacked to the northeast!
Hurry up and turn it on!"
"I hacked a heater to the southwest!
Use it to stop up the blizzard!"
"I'm done hacking the heater
to the southeast!
Head over there now!"
The blizzard has stopped.
Aww yeah! Payback time!
"More... There's still more...
I must eat every last one of you!"
"Please stop, Mari-san! I know you're
still kind deep down!"
The hell'd she do? Where is she!?
"She's shrouded herself in white fog.
How vexing..."
"Everyone, look out! She'll eat you if
you touch her!"
"Getting eaten is the last thing we
want. Can we use anything as a
shield!?"
"Ohh... I must... consume...
everything!"
"Huh? She's not coming after us?
Maybe she's too busy eating!"
"Then it's our chance! Let's get her
before she starts movin'!"
"Look at the size of this blizzard...
Her lungs must really be something."
"Stop that! Arghhh... I've done
nothing to deserve such agony!"
"The enemy's in great pain!
Looks like she's weak to
[1B]M0~6~Psychokinesis attacks!"
"Aaaagh! No... No!!! I wanted to dye it
white as snow!"
"It looks like she's weak to
[1B]M0~9~Curse attacks!
Get busy, Joker!"
"No... This cannot be... If I fall...
What kind of monster will...?"
......
......
"Sophie, is this where you saw the
heater?"
"Yes, it should be on top over there."
But will we be able to get that high?
"Is there anything we could use as
footing? Go check it out!"
"Look, Joker! I think you can climb up
those chains!"
Drop that chandelier on her!
Make her spit up from the impact!
L-L-Listen!
"There's a checkpoint nearby, but its
transportation function seems to
have gone kaput!"
"So that means we can't go back...
Did the snowstorm do this too?"
"A-A-Anyway! Let's just go to where
Sophie's talking about!"
"I'm glad the snowstorm stopped and
all..."
"But there seems to be nothing here.
Let's head back toward Odori Park
for now."
"All right, this oughta stop the
snowstorm."
"Oh! The checkpoint's functionality
is back!"
"I guess that Shadow was blocking it.
Now we should be able to go back
and forth like we want."
Huh? The checkpoint's still dead...
"There may be something else
interfering. All right, let's double
back."
...So where're the other cores?
"This seems to be the only path we can
take. Let's keep moving."

"Dude, what's gotten into her!?"
She said it was a voice...
"Whatever it is, we have to catch up
to her!"
"What's the deal with this place?
It's so creepy..."
"Are you holding up, Queen?"
"Ah! Yes, fine. Let's hurry up and
find Sophie."
This looks like someone's diary...
"""Today's the best day of my life!
I never thought I'd get to work
on a dream project like this!"""
"""This isn't just an AI, this is the
biggest advancement ever in
humanity attaining true bliss!"""
What the crap was that!?
"Could those have been the echoes
of the tortured souls here haunting
the halls?"
What in the... Give me a break...
"Hey, why's it gotta get so dark on us?"
"It has grown even eerier as well.
What lies in wait ahead of us?"
"The visibility level's a real issue, but
I'm still worried about Sophie. Let's
proceed with caution."
"Not that way! We should go the way
Sophie did!"
"Shadow—just on the other side!
Be careful..."
"Sooo, this is a research lab for
computer stuff?"
"That's supposedly the case, despite
the facility projecting a ""human
experimentation"" ambiance..."
Human experimentation!?
"That would mean this place's
Monarch views the real facility
in the same way..."
"Ugh, what an effin' gross way to
see shit..."
"Looks like some notes
on an experiment..."
"""Determining the Effects of a
Change of Heart:"""
"""We ordered the island locals to
eliminate anyone who comes near
the laboratory without clearance."""
"""This shall test the change
of heart's ability to facilitate
complex commands..."""
"""As well as any remaining latent
consciousness—more specifically,
whether their morals remain."""
"Looks like someone's
old research diary..."
"""This research is detestable. How
could humans ever experiment on
each other's very souls like this?"""
"""I must stop this travesty. I'm going
to march into the Director's office
and tell him it's wrong, right now!"""
"So many containers... What do you
think's inside?"
"They appear to be roughly
person-sized."
"C'mon! Don't put those kinds of
thoughts in our heads!"
......
"Queen's behavior has grown
unusual for her. Is something
wrong?"
"Ummm... Maybe the best way to
put it is, we all have our strengths
and our weaknesses."
"It looks like some sort of record,
but parts of it have been redacted..."
"""Name: ■■■■; Role: Chief"""
"""Now designated subject C82.
Assigned to experimentation
for leaking confidential intel."""
"There's a note hastily scrawled
on this torn piece of paper..."
"""Why did this happen?
Where did we go wrong?"""
"""Please, give me the answer."""
"I can still hear the voice. Does its
owner recognize me?"
"Hey, don't go overthinkin' it, Sophie."
"He's right, you know. Our expert on
not thinking gives pretty good advice
there!"
"Yeah! Listen to the— Hey, shuddup!"
"I wonder what happened to the
director after the last recording..."
"I sincerely doubt anything good...
He sounded as if he was beyond
wits' end."
"So, from Alice all the way here to the
director—everyone was just being
used for something?"
"If the perpetrator is still out there,
we have to stop them. Hopefully
this place will have some answers."
"Oh boy, that one looks dangerous!"
"It's super-powerful! On your toes, guys!"
"It's near—the voice is coming from
up ahead."
"It looks like we're taking this
elevator if we're going any further..."
"...Except that it's locked. Apparently
it's for personnel only."
"Leave it to me! Just a few seconds
and I'll ""hire"" us all!"
"Thank you, Oracle. I will protect you,
no matter what."
Look out—incoming warden!
"Hey, Sophie! Snap out of it! We gotta
work together on this thing!"
"Yes, right."
What!? This thing's got an AXE!?
"Be careful! Looks like this one can
use the other wardens' attacks!"
Crap! It's charging us now!
"So it can control its speed that well...
Don't sell this one short, everyone!"
"It raises its shields whenever
bolstering itself... How aggravating."
"Steer clear of it for now—focus on
healing up and stuff in a safe spot!"
*gasp* What strength...!
Here it comes! Dodge it!
"You'll be fine if you stay elevated!
See anything you can hop onto?"
It has quite a few tricks up its sleeves. I can't predict its movements.
"Dodging all of this will be too tough.
We should focus more on guarding."
"It takes all these hits AND we can't
read its next attack... This thing's
really getting on my nerves!"
"Hang in there, guys! Just keep your
eyes on its movements!"
"That thing's swings remind me
of Queen's... Wait, is this thing
LEARNING from us!?"
"If so, that spells real trouble! We've
gotta take it down now!"
I am... worthless?
"Sophie, just focus on our enemy
for now!"
"Even my directive is worthless.
I'll never be a good companion..."
In that case... why do I exist?
......
"C'mon Sophie, keep it together!
We got your back!"
"Warden: down! Great job, guys!"
......
It's a tape recorder...
"This plan brings to fruition a dream
long-cherished by the research team—
no, by all mankind!"
"Every last test subject, a successful change of
heart!"
"When the Penitentiary System is complete,
the concept of suffering will be dead to all
mankind!"
"Now, let us rejoice and welcome the new age
of humanity!"
"EMMA shall be our guide into this promised
land!"
The recording ends there...
It's a tape recorder...
"Please, Director Ubukata! We must immediately
abort the experiment! It's too dangerous!"
"These are the orders I was given. If the system
isn't tested on real humans, it won't ever be
completed."
But—tricking the islanders into participating!?
"You know what happens to a person when their
Desire is taken, Director!"
"We've learned of another party manipulating
the cognitive world for their own purposes in
the real one."
"We cannot allow these individuals to progress
beyond us! So long as we follow the divine
revelation, we will attain the ideal society."
"I have absolute faith in the system as it was
prophesied to me."
"What ideal society turns its entire population
into slaves!?"
"This isn't any divine revelation—it's a curse!
It can only lead to our destruction!"
The recording ends there...
It's a tape recorder...
Hand over the Desires?
"Not just the locals, but my own as well!?"
"So that's why I was made the test Monarch...
He planned on turning me into just another
puppet!"
"I can't believe I fell for it. Just some pathetic
clown dancing at his fingertips..."
"But he's not going to win... He can't take this
from me!"
My Desire is but my own...
I refuse to simply give it up!
The recording ends there...
It's a tape recorder...
This is my final record.
I've done... such a terrible thing.
"The Penitentiary System is nothing like he
told me... It's not made to save humanity."
"He's going to control everyone... Even the
Monarchs."
"All of humanity, nothing more than slaves...
That was the secret purpose of this project."
"Even my own Desire will be seized, any moment
now..."
"But as long as I still have it... I can put an end to
this myself."
It seems the tape ends there...
"Okay, now the elevator should be
operational! Time for us to find this
mystery voice!"
"Anyone feeling wiped out from that
fight? We could head back for a bit
if anyone thinks it's necessary."
"If you have any plans to change up
the party, please include me. I wish
to ascertain the owner of the voice."
"Hmm... I'll leave that to you, Joker."
I'm sorry...

"Keep an eye out for Akane-chan.
We need to be quick, or else!"
"Question. If this is a Jail, doesn't that
mean the Shadow Akane's here and
not the real one?"
"Right, only her Shadow should be
here—but that doesn't mean there's
no danger!"
"If something happens to her Shadow,
her life could be at risk! So let's find
her!"
"Not a Shadow in sight... Why might
that be?"
"Something's really strange about this
Jail... Be ready for anything, guys."
"You'd better hide if you see
something coming—you're
a goner if you get caught!"
"I know, I know. That's why I need
your backup, Saku— Uh, Oracle."
"Found a key, huh? You think we'll
need it?"
"No clue. Could wind up being useful,
though... Call it intuition."
"Zenkichi, look out! Shadow ahead!
Go another way!"
Dammit! Better find a clearer path...
"Incoming, dead ahead! Hide or it's
over!"
Roger...
"Okay, looks like they're gone.
Now's your chance!"
"Heh... Been a while since I felt this
jumpy."
Another enemy! Hide!
"Whoooa. Man, was that close..."
"Okay, I don't see 'em. Am I good,
Oracle?"
"Yeah, should be. But don't get
careless, all right?"
Enemy approaching! Get outta there!
Whew... This an okay spot?
"Yeah, not bad at all! You're growing
thiefier by the minute!"
"Is that a compliment—or even a word? Either way, not sure I'm a fan..."
There they are! In that cell!
"Great, let's spring 'em. Just a second,
kids..."
"What the— What happened to my
clothes!? Am I finally losing my
marbles?"
"Is that his phantom thief attire!?
And... he has a Persona!"
What are you waiting for!? Get him!
"Here they come, Zenkichi! Get
ready!"
"Ready HOW!? Agh, never mind—
guess I just gotta wing it!"
"Yeah, get 'em, Gramps! Mess their
shit up!"
"He's amazing... He's moving like
someone half his age!"
"How 'bout you cut the wisecracks
and let me do my thing? I sure
don't feel half my age!"
"Although raising a bit o' hell all
decked out like this is pretty sweet,
I gotta say!"
"*pant* Was that... *pant*
the last of them?"
"No... No! How'd he do that?
This can't be happening!"
"Just hang tight, Akane... I'm on my
way."
"Stay focused, Wolf. We don't have
a clue what's ahead of us."
"He's right—letting your emotions
get the better of you won't do
Akane-chan any good, Wolf."
"Yeeeah... So, I really have to use a
code name, huh?"
"I know we can't stick around here,
but this place sure is pretty..."
"This shrine is a pretty big tourist spot
in the real world. It looks just like
this if you come here at night."
"We can come back once this is
all over. We can even bring
Akane-chan with us."
"So, when passing under the gates,
you should pick a side. Walking
in the middle is poor manners."
"Oh, I remember hearing that before.
Are there any other rules?"
"Well, I suppose if we're to follow
proper courtesy, we should bow
before passing under each one..."
"Come on, you see how many there
are! It'd take us all day just to get
past here."
"Actually, it's already nighttime."
"C'mon, we don't have time for this.
Akane's waiting for us."
These are... foxes?
"The path continues down beyond
those gates, but with that thing
here, we're not getting through..."
Then we'd better check out some other paths for clues. Time for some legwork...
"Wha— Uhhh, where are we? This
ain't where we came from... right?"
"Ah-ha... So if we pass through one of
those swirling things, we end up
somewhere else in the Jail entirely..."
"*sigh* So we can't even just walk
where we want to anymore?"
"That means our only choice is to
see where our feet shall lead us."
"Right! Let's see how far they can
take us!"
Uh-oh... Looks like a dead end.
"Hang on, doesn't that fox statue
remind you of anything?"
"It does appear similar to the pair
that currently blocks our route—
more specifically, half of the pair."
"There's gotta be something to it,
then. Let's check it out."
"Oh, have you sensed something
with your sleuthing skills?"
"I'm no kind of sleuth—I'm a PubSec
agent."
"Careful, people—Shadow incoming!"
Hmm? Shining fox eyes?
Hmmm...
"No, not me—the statue."
"They do look like they're shining...
I wonder why?"
"If something affected this statue,
then maybe the other one that
looks like it was affected too..."
"Daaamn, Gramps, you really are a
sleuth, aren'tcha? You should be on
one of those cop shows."
"I'm already a cop in real life, genius!"
"Either way, let's double back. Maybe
we should return to the statues?"
"Hey, something DID happen to the
statue!"
"Its eyes are shining too—but it looks
like the other one wasn't affected."
"Looks like we're hunting for the
other fox statue now..."
"So you think we'll be able to use the
path if we light up both statues' eyes?"
"It's not like we got anything else to
try... I say we give it a shot."
You're the sleuth here.
"Ooh! Inari statue, ahoy!"
"Just so you know, Inari are not
literally foxes. That's just a form
they're said to take when on Earth."
"Oookay... So, based on what we saw
earlier, the eyes should light up once
we defeat a Shadow. But, where is it?"
"Speak of the devil and he appears...
Let's get this over with!"
Right! We're on it!
The eyes are shining now.
"Perfect! Let's get back to the other
statues—hopefully we can proceed
now."
"Both statues do appear affected
now... Oh?"
"Hell yeah, we're on our way!"
"Yeah, let's get going!"
"Wolf, Akane is just beyond here—
I have sleuthed her location."
"Kinda strange when an AI puts it
that way..."
"But my senses are telling me the
same thing. I'm almost there,
Akane..."
"Wh-Who are these guys!? Why do
they look just like us!?"
"Are they... the Phantom Thieves in
Akane's cognition!?"
"Her cognition's... what? What does
that even mean?"
"They're just some phonies! But they
sure won't look like us when we're
done with 'em!"
"Hmph, we'd better make it quick.
Hang on, Akane! I'm coming to get
you!"
"Go, my Phantom Thieves! Rid us
of these impostors!"
"Don't back down! Show him the real
Joker's might!"
"What!? How could— My Phantom
Thieves!"
Now's our chance! Lay into him!
"This guy's super fast! Look for some
sort of opening!"
"Even the attacks are exact copies!
Talk about copyright infringement!"
"How could a remake be so close to
the original!? Keep your cool, Joker!"
"Hang in there, Joker! Don't you lose
to that fraud!"
Yes! Now's your chance!
"How? How could you even do that?
My Phantom Thieves can't lose!"
"We need to snap her out of it...
Finish him, quick!"
"Stop...! What have you done to my
Phantom Thieves!?"
"Looks like it's working! Keep it up,
Joker!"
"Damn these effin' copycats...
Get your own thing!"
"Hmph, I admit he looks pretty good,
but he still doesn't have anything on
ME!"
"Ngh, he even matches my speed!?"
"Fighting someone who does
everything you do is so
annoying!"
"These might be our strongest foes
yet... Careful, everyone!"
"Akane-chan, please! Stop this!
We're on your side!"
"Shut up! Just, shut up! Only the
Phantom Thieves are on my side!"
"Nobody believes in justice anymore!
That's why I have to carry out my
own!"
"I had no idea I'd made it so bad
for you, Akane..."
"I'm so sorry. I won't run from the
truth anymore... Please, come back
to me!"
"My Phantom Thieves... lost!?
No... This can't be real!"
"Sounds like we got intruders. What's the status
on that fox statue?"
"Don't worry. They won't be getting anywhere,
not unless they reach the [1B]C2Father Fox Shrine[1B]R."
"Ah, that's right... The [1B]C2Father Fox Shrine[1B]R is deep
within the complex. They'll never find it."
Right. Now let's get back to patrol.
"Hey! Who gave you permission to slack off!?
Get your ass over to the [1B]C2Father Fox Shrine[1B]R!"
Uh... Remind me where that was again?
"How many times must I tell you!?
The [1B]C2Father Fox Shrine[1B]R is all the way
northeast of the complex!"
You mean I gotta walk all that way? Fine...
"Man, I keep getting lost no matter what I do...
How am I supposed to go anywhere?"
"You might want to start by learning where
you're at—the location name in particular.
For instance, this here's the [1B]C2Path of Harmony[1B]R."
"Okay... So if I keep going down this path, I'll
reach [1B]C2Parental Square[1B]R?"
"Yup. And any time you need to get your
bearings, make a mental note of your location
and where the road is taking you."
"So it seems there's something we need to do at
the [1B]C2Father Fox Shrine[1B]R... I say we check it out."
"*sigh* Patrol duty's the pits. All we do is pace
around like idiots, back and forth, over and
over, and for what? I'm sick and tired of this."
"Yeah, well get over it! This is our job, so get it
done right!"
"How can I when I can't even remember how to
get anywhere!?"
"Ahh, once you're fully acclimated, you can get
around with your eyes closed. Just pay attention
to where you are and where the paths take ya."
"For example, this is the [1B]C2Path of Fortune[1B]R, right?
Keep going and you'll reach the [1B]C2Father Fox[1B]R
[1B]C2Shrine[1B]R."
"Oh, right... I forgot how close the [1B]C2Father Fox[1B]R
[1B]C2Shrine[1B]R was. We better guard that at all costs."
"Did you guys hear that? This path leads to the
[1B]C2Father Fox Shrine[1B]R."
"Hmm... but we don't exactly know where the
[1B]C2Father Fox Shrine[1B]R is."
"Hey, I think I hear that furball mewlin' away.
You wanna go catch it?"
"No way, I'm not getting in trouble for leaving
my post."
"...Speaking of which, why are we chasing a cat
again?"
"Because the [1B]C2Ancient Lord[1B]R's been off his rocker,
saying a cat's been causin' him trouble."
"But how would a cat even get here? You can't
reach the [1B]C2Ancient Lord[1B]R from where we are now."
"Yeah, well unlike us, cats can go wherever they
darn well please."
0
"By the way, I hear that cat got the drop on the
[1B]C2Ancient Lord[1B]R and gave him a good scratchin'!"
"You gotta be ""kitten"" me!"
"All right. This couldn't be any further from the
[1B]C2Father Fox Shrine[1B]R... Meaning I can finally catch
a break."
"Hey, what was the little area before you reach
the [1B]C2Father Fox Shrine[1B]R again?"
"Ah, that would technically be [1B]C2Parting Square[1B]R.
It'll lead you directly to the [1B]C2Father Fox Shrine[1B]R."
"Wait, that doesn't make sense. I thought
Beckoning Cat Square led directly to the
[1B]C2Father Fox Shrine[1B]R."
"Sure, maybe if you're lookin' at a map. But go
out from [1B]C2Parting Square[1B]R and you'll end up
smack-dab at the [1B]C2Father Fox Shrine[1B]R. Trust me!"
How can I when you're not making any sense!?
"Hey, what's the deal with this memo?
Can I just toss it?"
"Whoa, not so fast! That memo has my secret
code on it!"
Really... Let's see here...
"""Note to self. Reaching the [1B]C2Mother Fox[1B]R
[1B]C2Shrine[1B]R requires the following ritual:"""
"""Couple, Harmony, Parental, Daughter, Fortune.
Don't forget to say your prayers!"""
"What kind of ritual is that...? And why is it the
""Mother"" Fox Shrine?"
"""Couple, Harmony, Parental, Daughter,
Fortune."" What does this tell us about how to
reach the Mother Fox Shrine?"
Always put family first.
Pray at the locations in order.
"What do you think, Queen?"
Family harmony brings fortune.
They're all locations.
Let's ask Queen.
"Ah, now that's a good saying. Nothing like
keeping the family bond alive... Except
that's not much of an answer."
"So if there's harmony between the couple,
maybe their daughter's more fortunate...?
But how does this relate to the shrines?"
"""Couple, Harmony, Parental, Daughter,
Fortune""... Where else have we heard this
before?"
"You can do this, Joker!"
I see... So we must visit these locations...
"And pray at each one! Nice work, Joker!"
"""Couple, Harmony, Parental, Daughter,
Fortune""... What are your thoughts, Joker?"
"Ah, that's it! There's a location that matches
each of those words!"
"So ""Couple"" would mean the [1B]C2Fox Couple Statue[1B]R
and ""Harmony"" refers to the [1B]C2Path of Harmony[1B]R."
"What about ""Don't forget to say your prayers""?
We didn't see any locations with ""pray"" in it."
"I think we're almost there, Joker. Let's finish
sorting this out."
"Now that we know the answer, let's be on our
way. Remember: ""Couple, Harmony, Parental,
Daughter, Fortune."""
I should offer a prayer...
This is the [1B]C2Fox Couple Statue[1B]R...
This is the [1B]C2Daughter Fox Shrine[1B]R...
This is the [1B]C2Harmony Shrine[1B]R...
This is the [1B]C2Parental Shrine[1B]R...
This is the [1B]C2Fortune Shrine[1B]R...
"Couple, Harmony, Parental, Daughter, Fortune..."
I wonder where that other fox statue is... I feel as though we've ran around the entire complex by now.
"Seems like we'll have to gather some more
info. Do you hear anyone talking nearby?"
Or maybe we can listen in on those guards again. See if you can pick up on a conversation from outside one of the buildings.
"All right... Let's see if we can find this
other fox statue based on the information
we gathered."
Now where can we find the statue we need?
The Mother Fox Shrine
The Father Fox Shrine
The Demon Fox Shrine
"Good thinking. If there's a Father Fox Shrine,
it makes sense there'd be a Mother Fox Shrine
to match."
"I think I'm starting to see it... The mother and
father foxes are the key to getting past the
Fox Couple Statue."
"So we need to find the Mother Fox Statue to
proceed. That sounds reasonable enough."
"C'mon. We already went to the [1B]C2Father Fox[1B]R
[1B]C2Shrine[1B]R. That's why its eyes are glowing on the
statue."
"It didn't seem like there was anything else worth
noting there. So, where would the other statue
be?"
Let's think it over again.
"Oh. Y-Yeah... There's gotta be a demon fox
statue here somewhere, right?"
"So that means we probably need to head to the
[1B]C2Mother Fox Shrine[1B]R... But what about that
ritual?"
You're the one not making sense!
"If we don't catch it soon, the [1B]C2Ancient Lord[1B]R at
[1B]C2Parting Square[1B]R is gonna get all pissed at
you again."
Next up is the [1B]C2Harmony Shrine[1B]R.
"Tch. He thinks he's better than us just 'cause he's
the one protecting the [1B]C2Father Fox Shrine[1B]R."
"Yeah, he went chasing after that cat he heard
and accidentally warped from [1B]C2Parting[1B]R
[1B]C2Square[1B]R to the [1B]C2Father Fox Shrine[1B]R."
"So in the end, a cat lured him into a fox's trap...
Hah, serves him right!"
"I believe that was: ""Couple, Harmony, Parental,
Daughter, Fortune."" Then after, ""Don't forget to
say your prayers."""
"What does that mean? Is that a prayer list of
some kind?"
"Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's not it. Stop spitting
platitudes and help us figure this out."
"To the [1B]C2Fox Couple Statue[1B]R we go! And let the
prayer-a-thon begin!"
Next up is the [1B]C2Parental Shrine[1B]R.
Next up is the [1B]C2Daughter Fox Shrine[1B]R.
The last one is the [1B]C2Fortune Shrine[1B]R.
"Did you guys catch that? The [1B]C2Father Fox Shrine[1B]R
is at the northeast corner of the shrine complex."
"So from here... That would mean we go back the
way we came, then north at the fork."
"That's why we investigate, kids. First thing you
do when you need more information. In fact,
you could say we were investigating just now."
"That was more eavesdroppin' than
investigating, but whatever. We're thieves.
We do that shit."
"Either way, let's scour the area and listen in
close if we hear any whisperings going on."
Sweet! Then let's get a move on!
All right. Be sure to keep an eye on the map.
"The [1B]C2Father Fox Shrine[1B]R is all the way to the
northeast... It really doesn't help that these
weird shrine gates keep warping us around."
We'll have to figure out an alternate way there.
"So we need to keep our location in mind
at all times... I suppose that's a good habit
to begin with."
"Well, it still stinks that we can't trust the paths
to take us where we want. Guess I'll turn off
navigation for now."
We did see a [1B]C2Father Fox[1B]R earlier... Could that mean there's also a [1B]C2Mother Fox[1B]R?
"I don't have a clue... Why don't we head back to
the [1B]C2Fox Couple Statue[1B]R and think this through?"
Quiet down... I hear voices in the distance.
"Maybe we can learn something if we listen in.
Let's go, Joker."
"Don't forget, we need to do that ritual...
Maybe it sounded like gibberish, but
it has to be some sort of clue."
"It seems like we're back at the
[1B]C2Daughter Fox Shrine[1B]R..."
"Dammit... Not here again. Which way
gets us to the [1B]C2Father Fox Shrine[1B]R?"
"Are there any pathways we haven't explored
yet? We may just have to check out every one
we find..."
"All right. Then we'll reach the [1B]C2Father Fox[1B]R
[1B]C2Shrine[1B]R by using our eyes and ears."
"It'll be mayhem if we're all in the
same place. Let's split up and take
'em out in one-on-ones!"
"Time to defeat these doppelgangers!
Wolf, Sophie, back us up!"
You know I've got your backs!
"Okay, got it! You guys can do it!"
Don't you guys dare lose!
"So this is the right way, then? Let's go!"
"You gotta be ""kitten"" me... Was he kidding,
Mona?"
"Don't ask me—I'm no kitten! ...Anyway, let's
just keep going."
Damn it... Where'd that cat go?
"Come to think of it, wasn't he recently found
absent from his post? Right after going on about
sticking to our patrol and everything..."
"I don't know what this ""kitten"" crap is, but
let me get this straight:"
"If we follow the sound of this cat from
[1B]C2Parting Square[1B]R... We'll finally be able
to warp to the [1B]C2Father Fox Shrine[1B]R."
Got it. So the beckoning cat knows the path.
"No, that doesn't seem right. What else could it
be..."
"The [1B]C2Father Fox Shrine[1B]R is at the northeast
corner of the complex."
"But if we try to follow the map, it'll only get us
warped all over the place..."
"Maybe there's a clue to this. I'm sure we'll find it
if we look carefully enough."

"Whoa, for real!?"
"I warned you. It'll shoot anything within its
detection range."
"One wrong step, and you're swiss cheese. Steer
clear of those surveillance cams, guys!"
"Sheesh, these Jails sure are dangerous..."
"Man, there's cameras friggin'
everywhere..."
"Those who refuse to do as they're told
will be eliminated without exception.
I imagine that's Konoe's goal here."
"...Why would he go so far? He's
nothing like the Phantom Thieves."
"So this is what cities might look like
in the future, huh? Place is so rigid
and orderly it's giving me the creeps."
"I don't like it either. Not to
mention, there's not one sweet
old lady in sight."
"Ahaha... Gotta say I agree too.
I prefer cities with actual people in them."
"Hold up! Security looks super tight
over that way! Let's try another route!"
"...All right, looks like we can make our
way to the Prison Keep from here."
"We've arrived at Juoji Zoo. Would
the Prison Keep be somewhere in
Mt. Chashiro, then?"
"Mt. Chashiro it is, then. Let's go,
everyone!"
"Hm, something's not right about you... Wait, I
see! You must be villains!"
"Say what? If anyone's a villain here, it's you, pal!"
"Enough talk! In the name of our hero, Akira, I will execute you here and now!"
Here it comes! Take it out!
"This may be a zoo, but I believe it's
in name only. I don't sense any life
from them."
"Something's being displayed inside
these cages... Are these supposed to
animals?"
"Maybe in his ideal world, he doesn't have time for things he can't control himself…"
"I see another cage. Is that an exhibit,
too?"
"Are these... Are these the people who were made
into Monarchs? This was all just some big show
to him!?"
"In reality, he likely saw them as a means to an end. They weren't much more than that."
"Rrgh... So this dickhead uses these people for all
their worth, and this is how he treats 'em? What
an asshole."
"I have to say, this city seems almost
devoid of life. Is this really the society
Konoe's hoping to create?"
"It's unsettling, but in a different way
from the research lab in Okinawa."
"If we get captured, there's a good
chance we'll end up in one of those
cages. Be careful, Meowgana."
"I'm not gonna get caught! And stop
calling me that!"
"There is an undeniable beauty in the
aesthetic of this place, but I sense
little passion from its creator."
"I know what you mean. I feel like
there's nothing to make it feel alive,
so it all feels sorta ""meh."""
"I get a little something from these,
though... See these slits with the light
coming out of 'em?"
"Oh, yeah... Your computer setup's
kinda like this, ain't it?"
"We can't get through. It looks like it's Oracle's
turn."
Roger! It's hacking time! Everyone ready?
"And that about does it!
On to Mt. Chashiro!"
"Hm? It looks like we can use these to
get to the other side."
"This should get us back into the Prison
Keep. I'm gonna hack in. Watch my back!"
"This area is off limits! Villains who violate the
rules will be purged!"
"Heh, what are you, some kinda watchdog? Let's
wrap this up quick and shut down those cameras!"
"There's nothing standing in our way
now! Time to climb that tower!"
"Hey, look! Are the security cameras
off now?"
"This will let us move around more
freely. Perhaps we should return to
Shinsekai at this time?"
"Yeah, there was that one place we
couldn't get to before. Maybe we
stop by and check it out?"
"It looks like that elevator'll take us closer to
Konoe's castle."
"We're finally making progress. We've still got
a long way to go, though..."
"This is certainly a change of scenery. It looks like
some sort of storage warehouse..."
Guess the castle's still pretty far off. This is gonna take some serious patience.
"...Uhh, does anyone else hear that? It sounds like
a plane or something."
"Oh, that's right, there was a train station nearby.
Maybe it'll have something to help us get around."
"Whoa, whoa, we're actually going
through here? You guys are nuts..."
Make sure to watch your step!
"Those are infrared sensors. I don't recommend
trying to pass through them."
Whaaat? But the station is right there...
"Hey, uh, I don't know a damn thing about this
kinda stuff, but couldn't we just turn those
things off?"
"That's true. There might be a Prison Keep that
controls the sensors."
Right. Let's see if we can find it.
"Look at all these containers... What
do you think's inside?"
"Judgin' from all the other shit lyin'
around, I'd say it's prolly weapons or
some kinda freaky machines."
"It could also be food. I wonder what
people from the future eat?"
"Bet you it's some kinda nutrient jelly
ration bar thing! That's the classic
dystopian diet!"
"Look, there are even more infrared
sensors here."
"We've really gotta do something
about those. Let's find that Prison
Keep ASAP."
"Oh, it opened."
This door... I wonder...
"Is it possible that it's connected to the switch of
the same color?"
"So if we see another door like this one, we
should find a switch to go with it."
"Holy shit, is that thing for real!?"
"*gasp* Omigosh, is that a railgun!?
That's THE weapon of the future!"
"You two are way too hyped about
this..."
"Oh, man. I bet that thing packs a
punch! C'mon, we gotta shoot it at
least once!"
This way seems to be blocked as well.
"This building... It looks like they're
shipping containers somewhere."
"Prolly the warehouse from earlier,
right? Place was friggin' full of
containers."
"Maybe we can use that as a shortcut
to get back to the warehouse."
"But we can't cross just yet... We have
to do something about those sensors
first."
Right. Let's find the Prison Keep.
Looks like we found our Prison Keep! Only thing now is... how do we get there?
"I don't see a keyhole... How is anyone supposed
to open this?"
"Well, the door's color is... white. So if this is like
the other ones..."
"Then, we gotta find a white switch! Let's take a
look around!"
"Man, you kids sure have a lot of
energy. My eyes are starting to hurt..."
"Is that so? Your mask's design led me
to believe it had built-in sunglasses."
"Phantom thieves are supposed to
move in darkness. What good would
sunglasses do?"
"The lights here are pretty blinding,
though. Do you want to take a break?"
"My mask has a shades mode built in.
We could have matching masks, Wolf."
"Uhh... I appreciate all the sentiment,
but I think I'll be fine."
"This door... It's not the type that opens with
a switch. We need Oracle for this one."
"All right, I'm gonna start the hack! You know
the drill!"
"So you're the ones who've been wrecking
our security!"
"Unacceptable... Prepare to face the almighty
hammer of justice!"
This one looks tough. Get ready!
"We've found the white switch. Now
we can get to the Prison Keep."
"Hell yeah! Let's head back and bust
our way in!"
"All right, it's open. Come on!"
"Intruders! Those who disturb the
peace will be purged!"
"Geez, it's just one cliché after another with these guys..."
"The enemy's been wiped out! Now's
your chance to get to the top!"
"That elevator over there should
drop us right off at the station!"
"Hopefully, this brings us closer to
Konoe's castle..."
This looks like an airport...
"The flight from Juoji bound for Abeno Haretas
will be departing shortly."
"Those who seek an audience with Lord Akira,
please make your way to the airship departure
gate."
Did you hear that? It said airship.
"An audience with Lord Akira... It sounds like
boarding this airship will take us straight to
the castle."
"Maybe... Still, Konoe controls every inch of this
place. I doubt we can just hop on."
"Wolf's right. Let's stay on guard as we make
our way to the departure gate."
"Hey! You haven't surrendered your Desires
yet, have you!?"
"Damn, they found us! Guess we'll just have
to take 'em out!"
"It looks like that last enemy dropped
something."
"A ""Worker's Pass,"" huh? Looks like we can
say goodbye to that vent."
So this is the departure gate...
Entry denied. Insufficient access privileges.
"Please surrender your Desires or present your
""VIP Pass."""
"""VIP Pass""? The hell's that?"
"So if we get one, even we'll be allowed inside?"
"That simplifies things a bit. Let's go find a pass,
then."
"But who would be carrying a VIP pass? I doubt
we could tell just by looking."
"If only we knew of a place where such
individuals might gather..."
"Well, if they're important enough to be called
VIPs... Maybe they'd be in the first class
lounge?"
"That's it, Noir! I had a feeling you'd know
something about the VIP life!"
Already got a reading! Let's check it out!
"This looks like the lounge... The door won't
open, though."
"We probably need something to gain access
to this place too. Maybe we should look
around?"
"Such garish scenery—they won't win any praise from me. This is hardly something I'd expect from ""first class."""
"Fox, this isn't the time! Focus on the enemy!"
"Hey, what's this? A permit to use the lounge?"
"Now that we have one, we can probably open
that door."
"So I guess the next step is to head to the lounge
and find a VIP pass, huh?"
"All right, we're off to the lounge! Let's go!"
"Whoa, who the hell are you? This area's VIP
only!"
"Yo, you think this guy's a VIP? Bet he's got a
pass."
"Oh, I'm sure we can get him to part ways
with it!"
"Hey, take it easy. This is less ""phantom thieves""
and more just... ""thieves."""
"Excellent, we have our VIP pass."
"Great, now we can ride that airship. Let's get
back to the departure gate!"
VIP Pass accepted. You are cleared to board.
"All right, it's open! Let's make our way to the
castle!"
"Wait, a sec... This is a Prison Keep!"
I get it... This must be an air-traffic control tower for the airships.
"It might be a good idea to get this place under
control if we want a safe flight."
"Agreed. If we can stop the other airships,
it might reduce enemy reinforcements later on."
"All right then, if that's the plan, let's make shit
happen!"
We got the core!
"Interesting... A Madicce company badge. Its
symmetrical design is rather appealing."
"We've cleared all of the Prison Keeps. Let's go
ahead and board the airship."
"Return what you've stolen from the tower
immediately. This is your only warning."
"Hmph, like a phantom thief would ever return
what they stole?"
"Filthy little rats... I shall take great pleasure in
granting you your destruction!"
Here it comes!
"Looks like we've finally cleared up
the rabble. Talk about a waste of time."
"Man, you sound like one of the bad
guys. Kinda suits you, honestly."
"He looks like one, too. Definitely
doesn't look like a cop."
"Oh, shut up. Let's hear you say that
after I put you all away."
"So that was an airship... The view
from the sky was truly breathtaking."
"My legs still feel all rubbery when
I walk..."
"I thought it was fun... In fact, I'd like
to go again."
"Hey, knock yourself out. Just save it
for after we take down Konoe."
"Guess that hero show or whatever's
wrapped up."
"I wonder what it was like. Kinda
curious, honestly."
"Oh, you wanna go see one
sometime? We can go to
a Featherman show!"
W-Wha!? What happened!?
"It seems we've been forcibly teleported
somewhere."
"Urgh, I don't feel so good... I think I'm warp-sick."
"What, so we're locked up? Man, I feel like
getting caught's all we ever do anymore..."
"We have to get out of here, and quickly..."
"Hey, just try to stay calm. In times like these
the best thing to do is to carefully check your
surroundings."
"The door's open on the other side. I wonder if
there's a way for us to get over there..."
"How did you escape!? Quit resisting and come
quietly!"
"Whoops, looks like we got company."
So these are the jerks that sprung the trap on us?
"I guess we should say thanks! Quit resisting and
get stomped!"
"This elevator looks like it'll take
us up, but they've got it
on lockdown..."
"There must be a mechanism to
release it somewhere. Let's see if we
can find it."
This must be the security room.
"It looks like we can unlock that elevator from
here."
"So if we release the lock, we'll be able to keep
going up. Can you hack it, Oracle?"
"Of course! Just gimme the word! And don't
forget to cover my six!"
"Yes, the elevator's working! Let's head
on up!"
"We should be able to ride all the way
up to the top like this. Maybe we can
even rest before we get there."
"...Guess that woulda been a little too
easy. Come on, let's greet our guests."
"Getting lots of Shadow readings here!
You guys are just gonna have to hold
out!"
Good grief... Finally at the top.
About damn time. Let's roll!
Seems we're quite a ways up.
Have we reached the roof yet?
"Stop! Picking up an enemy nearby! This one
looks tough!"
"You fools dare oppose the great hero Akira?
My lightning will turn you into dust!"
...It's an elevator.
"Yo, we have to go up even more!?"
It looks really high... I can't even see the top.
"Well, given Konoe's elevated opinion of himself,
I'd say this is par for the course..."
"Guess we're going up, then. We gotta get those
Desires back!"
"It's like I'm some kind of joke to people... You
want to die? Trust me, I'll be glad to get rid of
you!"
"This guy's sick... He really killed his own wife
over some money!?"
"Unbelievable... That monster! How could anyone
do something so awful!?"
"Hey, don't let yourselves get caught
up in the trauma! Try to stay calm!"
"Yeah, well... It's hard to stay calm
after the shit we just saw."
"A protector of justice? Hahahahaha!
Did one of those things save you?"
"So this is why Konoe was trying to
become a hero."
"Because no one was there to save
him? That's terrible..."
"Wipe that stupid look off your face!
I call the shots, you little shit!"
Damn... This makes me sick.
"Let's see you keep up that mopey
little face when you're dead!
Hahahahaha!"
"Rocket launchers? Shit, he's packing
some serious heat."
"That thing's got a ton of firepower!
Stay outta the crosshairs!"
"Dammit... Bastard shoots us 'n runs
away! Come back here, asshole!"
"Hit-and-run tactics... What a
nuisance."
"Would you just die already? Your
mother knew when to quit, why
don't you!?"
"Watch out! It can still attack while
it's moving!"
"So that was Konoe's father... Konoe
suffered all alone for so long..."
Sophie...
I am the enforcer of righteousness! The hero who will purge the wicked from every corner of the globe!
"Prepare yourselves, Phantom Thieves, and watch
as I shatter your illusory sense of justice with my
own two hands!"
"Oh, come on! He's got a mech!?"
"Careful, I'm picking up major energy 
spikes from that thing!"
It even looks super-powered...
"Looks more like a kid's toy to me.
Can't say I'm big on doing this, but...
Let's give it all we got!"
"Maybe we can use those rails on the
upper platforms to dodge the
enemy's attacks? "
"Check out those rails. They might
help us outmaneuver Konoe."
"Hey, those guns look familiar, yeah?
How 'bout we give that asswipe a
little shock!?"
"Those things are lethal, but it takes a
minute for them to fire. You're gonna
have to time this carefully."
"All weapons at maximum firepower...
Justice will always prevail against evil!"
"Oh, yo, holy shit! Is this thing for real!?"
There's gotta be an opening somewhere! Just focus on avoiding him for now.
The enemy's stopped moving! It's overheated!
Now's our chance! Shoot him down!
What!?
"Yes, we got him!"
"This is when we beat him up, right?"
"Systems cooled down and
back online. Hit me with your
best shot!"
"Rats, it's already back in action.
Watch out, guys!"
I will purge all traces of evil... None will be left standing!
"Steer clear, everyone! You don't
wanna get hit by that!"
"Steer clear how!? Maybe we can get
to higher ground!?"
Damn... That firepower's no joke!
"What if we try using those rails?
Maybe we can get behind him!"
"All guns, fire! Leave nothing left!"
"Whoa, they're following us!?"
"Those are homing missiles! Think you
can shake 'em!?"
Let fall the hammer of justice!
Shiiit! He's even got a rocket pu—
"Skull, get out of the way!"
He can fly!?
Dammit!
"Traditional superhero antics, it seems..."
"We don't stand a chance when it's
down at our level. Get out of its attack
range as soon as you can!"
"Ngh... You pests! Move, my vessel of
justice!"
He's down! It's go time!
"What do you mean, ""system failure""!?
Why you...!"
"The enemy's shorted out!
[1B]M0~4~Electricity's your friend here!"
What!? My armor!
"[1B]M0~7~Nuclear attacks are go!
Let him have it!"
"Damn, he's tough! There's gotta be a
rule about bringin' a giant robot to a
fight, right?"
"Surrender, Phantom Thieves. Submit
to my justice or die!"
I am the hero in this story. I will create a world without evil!
"You'll be creating one without hopes
or dreams, too! It's not right!"
"No way I'm gonna let you use Mom's
research for that!"
"Your little group could never hope to
accomplish what I could."
"This is a necessity. The world needs a
new system—it's the only way."
You would be forcing that system on the rest of us... You'd be no better than a dictator!
"We'd all just be told how to live
without making any decisions for
ourselves... I won't go back to that!"
"Ngh... No, not yet!"
I will not bend to evil... I refuse!
"How unfortunate. Such an indomitable will, yet you've strayed so far from your path..."
"No matter your reasons, you still used an innocent girl as a means to an end. I'll make you pay for that!"
But the hero can't lose... He must be victorious!
"A hero must stand his ground. He
must not let evil overcome him!"
"He may be our enemy, but you've gotta admire his determination."
"Mech or not, he's really taking it up
a notch! Watch your backs, guys!"
"Hey, check out those wings!
Think we can use 'em to get
the jump on him!?"
What is all this? This stuff drop from the robot?
Careful. Hitting those with enough force will cause them to explode.
"It explodes, huh? Maybe we can use
that to our advantage!"
Arrgh! That was a cheap trick!
"Nice, he felt that one! It's working!
Keep on him!"
Let's see if you can keep up with this!
"Since when could he move like that!?
He's gotta be cheating!"
"In the name of justice, I will vanquish the evils of this world!"
"Ngh, what terrifying swordsmanship!"
"Don't just swing away at him. Pay
close attention to his movements!"
You will fall by my blade!
"Holy shit, back off, dude! Take it out on the wall or somethin'!"
That may be possible. What if we lured Konoe into the wreckage of his mech?
May the light of justice flood this soiled earth!
"This is the power to annihilate the
wicked! Haaaaaah!"
"Uh oh, this looks bad... Get away from him! Hurry!"
"There is no escape, evildoers!"
"We've got attacks coming in from all
sides! Look out!"
There... I'll crush you!
Come. I'll show you what a true hero is made of!
"Damn, he's quick... Doesn't help that
I'm in my forties, either!"
"Even if I lose my wings, the fire of
justice will never fade!"
"He's jumping at us from the
wreckage! Watch out, here
he comes!"
Strength in the face of adversity! That is the unmistakable mark of a hero!
"Man, if only you gave as much of a shit about actually helping people!"
Guh... This is nothing!
Konoe's stopped moving! Hit him fast and hit him hard!
"Ngh, my armor won't move!"
That's it! [1B]M0~4~Electric attacks are the name of the game! Keep it up!
Urrgh! This won't be enough to stop me!
"That did it! Looks like he's weak to
[1B]M0~7~Nuclear attacks!"
"What's the difference between me and those you've saved? Why couldn't I be saved, too?"
"I will bring the world to a new era of
righteousness! One that refuses to
tolerate evil of any kind!"
"This feeling... It's so unsettling. This
must be sadness."
"Yes, this is sad. But that's exactly why
we have to stop him. Before he makes
any more mistakes."
"Why!? Why can't you share my
vision!?"
"I'm ridding the world of evil, just as you are... We're doing the same thing, Phantom Thieves!"
"You're wrong, Konoe. The Phantom
Thieves would never steal someone
else's freedom."
"You would sacrifice whoever it took
to achieve your goal... Your father
would've done the exact same."
"Take a good look at all these guys have done, Konoe. Maybe then you'll see where you went wrong."
Ngh... I won't accept defeat...
The hero has to win... Justice has to win!
"Couldn't have said it better myself!
That's why we're takin' you down!"
"All right, guys! Finish him off!"
Urrgh... No... I can't lose! Not now!
"Okay, the lock opened just like we thought! Now to make our way up on those chains!"
"I saw the Prison Keep over that way. Let's head
east first."
"Gonna be kind of a trek. We better brace
ourselves."
Whoa! It actually shot at us!
"It seems forcing our way through won't do us
any good."
I'm gonna look for a safer route and put it up on our map.
"Might be kinda roundabout, but it's better than
being blown to smithereens."
"It seems the enemy
dropped something..."
"This is the First Class Lounge. Please present your ""Lounge Pass."""
We need a pass for here too? You're kidding.
So we can't go through from the front... We'll just have to find some kind of back entrance.
"What's this? Ooh, is it a VIP Pass...!? Nope."
"Perhaps the enemy we fought just now wasn't a
VIP. Still, this does say ""Lounge Pass"" on it..."
Maybe it will open the door to the lounge room?
"There're a couple other first class lounges! Let's
go check 'em out!"
"Whoa, the airship's HUGE!"
"Seeing it up close, it's much larger than I
imagined."
"All right, let's hop on and take this thing straight
to the castle!"
...This door's locked.
"These types usually open with a switch, but I
don't see anything like that nearby..."
"We'll just have to find some kind of secret
passage. Any idea where we should look?"

"Dude... So we're like, just...
stuck here!?"
"I'd say so. I tried exiting, but no such
luck."
"That means all we can do is press on.
Keep ready, everyone."
This place feels... grimy and confined.
"I agree. I'm not sure how to put it...
It's as if it's generating a wellspring
of revulsion within me."
Who could have brought us here?
"I dunno, but whoever built the place
is outta their effin' mind..."
"Man... Just when things were on the
upswing, this crap has to happen."
"The upswing, huh? So the case is
going well now?"
"Sure is—thanks to you all. The boss
and I are working out the last kinks
of our plan of attack."
"Worse comes to worst, she'll even
be able to bring the hammer down
without me."
"Not happenin', Cappenin'! You
promised Akane you're getting
even with Owada!"
"Heh, you're right—but that's not
on the table unless we can get
out of here."
"There's a tough-looking one—don't
let your guard down!"
"Hey, so this place really is a Jail and
not actually Mementos, right?"
"That's what we were told...
Whatever it is, it's giving me
a bad feeling."
"Now get going, Sophia."
Understood.
"Sophie, please! Snap out of it!"
"Ngh... Sophie! Don't you know who
we are!?"
"Phantom Thieves are opponents.
They require elimination."
Sophie!
"There's no point in talking to her.
Sophia cannot defy my commands."
"So you really are the one who made
Sophie?"
"Yep, she might just be an early
version of EMMA, but she's still
quite impressive, eh?"
"Gah, do we really have to go all out
here?"
"No! We can't hurt Sophie—she's our
friend!"
"Don't be ridiculous! She'll take off
our heads if we don't stop her
somehow!"
"And THEN who's going to save the
world? We have to figure out how
to stop her!"
......
"I'm worried about Sophie. Let's find
a way out of here, and quickly."
"We should try gaining altitude when
we can. Considering how far we fell
down here..."
"Damn that Ichinose! I can't believe
she's played us this whole time!"
"And how she mind-controlled
Sophie? 100 percent uncool."
"To think of her amusement as we
struggled with each Monarch..."
"If we're gonna take back everyone's
Desires, we have to stop her, no
matter what!"
"Ichinose-san created Sophie, right?
So she could understand the human
heart?"
"She said she doesn't have one, but...
is that really possible?"
"Well, she claims it's unnecessary, but really— Wait. We should be looking for a way out first."
"It appears we go no further until we
defeat that one."
Ugh! We don't have time for this!
"This one's super tough! Stay on your
toes, folks!"
"We've made serious progress here,
but there's still no exit in sight..."
"Just hang on a little longer, Sophie."
......
"Ichinose's just ahead of us.
Are we ready?"
"Right—we can't let her keep making
fools of the Phantom Thieves. Time
for some payback!"
"There's a whole lot of 'em... Give it
everything you've got, guys!"
"Heh, it don't matter how many
weaklings they throw at us—
we'll crush 'em all!"
"Ahahaha, don't you see that's
pointless? You're all getting
blasted again pretty soon."
"All right, I'm starting the frequency
hack! Watch my back, guys!"
"Keep Ichinose's attention until I can
drop that barrier!"
"You really don't know when to give
up—do you actually think you're
going to stop me?"
"Unfortunately for you, ""give up"" is
not a phrase found in the Phantom
Thieves' vocabulary."
"Even with the whole world turned
against us, we fight for our beliefs!"
That's pretty much our entire deal!
"As long as we're still breathing,
we press on!"
......
"That said, I'm not sure how much
longer we can do this... Hurry up,
Oracle!"
"Oh-ho! I was wondering why it was
taking so long to charge up. So this
is your fault, Futaba-chan?"
"That's right—you against me,
Ichinose!"
"Ahahaha, now that sounds fun!
I'm not too familiar with how
things are done here, buuut..."
"Basically, all I need to do is just think
up a barrier program, right?"
Whoa! How'd it just—!?
"This is bad... If we don't stop it, we're the ones who go down here!"
"Man, this is a tough fight! We're all
counting on you, Oracle!"
*gasp* *pant* Did we do it?
"Nice try, Phantom Thieves—but no.
Sorry."
"Dammit, there's not enough time!
I'm sorry, guys... Get out! Quick!"
Sophie! Are you okay now?
"Yes. I heard you all the entire time...
Thank you."
"I want to stop Ichinose! Will you
help me?"
But of course! We'll do it together!
"But how? You were clearly running
on fumes, how does adding one
person...?"
"She's not just ""one person""—she's
our beloved friend and teammate!"
"Yeah! Sure she's just one robot,
but that's not all she is—not like
YOU'D get it, though!"
"I don't need to. The laser's almost
fully charged—"
"Oh, but is it? Did someone get
soooo distracted that they left
themselves wide open for me!?"
Ngh! The power's...
"Sophia, I just don't get you...
The only thing a heart does is
open a person up to suffering!"
"What makes you actually want
one? Why would you go and do
something so foolish!?"
"It's not foolish at all. My heart gives
me the power to protect my friends."
"You just want to convince yourself
a heart is worthless so you won't be
tortured over discarding your own."
"You're merely lying to yourself in the
hope that you won't hurt anymore!"
"Shut up... Shut up! How the hell
could a program understand the
human heart anyway!?"
"That takes care of the Shadows!
Time for you to throw in the towel,
Ichinose!"
......
Ichinose?
How could Sophia... when I can't...
Haha... Hahahaha...
"Looks like this area's safe. Let's rest
up while we can."
"All right, let's roll out!"

"Are these... tree roots or something?
They're super-creepy..."
"Trees often represent life and
fertility, but these roots look
much more sinister than usual."
"The elevator's not going to do us
any good like this. I suppose we'll
have to climb our way up."
"We haven't much time. Do any
stairwells reach the server room?"
"No, but if we can reach the main deck,
we should find another elevator."
"Then let's head there. See any places
where we can gain elevation?"
"Yikes, check out this mess! Hey,
Panther—think you can burn out
some of this stuff?"
"You really want me to try that? If it
worked, we'd be surrounded by fire
pretty quick."
"Now here's a problem—what else
could we use to get higher?"
"The building infrastructure has
become rather wild. It has been
warped in an artful way."
"Focus on the danger instead of the
aesthetics—parts of this floor are
crumbling."
"Look, the wall's broken over there.
You can see into the floor above us."
"I bet we can get higher through
there. Let's check it out, Joker."
"This place is worse off than the
floor below us. I wonder how
bad it's going to get..."
"I only hope these roots don't keep us
from reaching our destination."
"If they get to be too much, just
leave it to me. I'll mow anything
down with my trusty axe!"
"Right, that's... great to hear."
Is this tower popular with tourists?
"Quite, it's a historic landmark of
Tokyo. Its marriage of function and
form gives it an almost regal air."
"We'll check it out when it's back to
normal one day, Sophie—first, we
have to turn it back the way it was."
"Just as the death of suffering is nigh,
the dawning of a new god too draws
near."
"Man shall attain its fate and be
delivered from doubt and strife.
Now, enter the Promised Land."
"No way is that happening! I don't
care how much doubt I have,
I want my freedom!"
"Not only that—suffering can have
positive outcomes as well, like
how we all met."
Fools...
"From the country's police forces to
basically a god—you guys really know
how to pick your battles, huh?"
"Yeah, true, we're good at pissin' off
people in power. I guess it's just our
specialty!"
"We all decided we're done playing
the games of the wicked! We'll take
on whoever's wrong, even a god!"
"Oh, yeah? Man, you guys are true-
blue underdogs."
"Hmm? Look, over there—a locked
door."
"This is merely conjecture, but I
suspect that is EMMA's server room."
0
"Stop! STOOOOP! Check out that
room first!"
"I think we can reach the main deck
through there."
"All right, let's get on up there!"
"Tell me, why are you resisting this
gift from your god?"
"You'll live on in a tranquil world,
free of all pain, yet you oppose it
with such fervor..."
"Because it's bullshit! If something
sounds too good to be true, then it
probably is."
"Tranquility born from a lack of
thought is nothing less than the
death of the self!"
How tragic...

Heeeey! Where'd everybody go!?
"What IS this!? I can't get anywhere
in this place!"

be toying with us?"

"Everyone, don't let the path fool
you!"
"Following it only sends you in
circles!"
You have to go off the path!
"I recall the server room being
around here."
"But man, hacking EMMA to send out
a calling card? Is that really possible?"
"It better be! I mean, it definitely is!
Otherwise, our whole world's done
for!"
"The last battle's finally upon us...
Make sure everyone's good and
prepared!"
"I exist to grant humanity's true Desire. It is my
divine calling to lead them to the Promised
Land."
"Should you intend to thwart humanity's goal
of enlightenment, it is my duty as their god
to vanquish you."
"Its power is incredible... I can
physically feel its pressure."
"I never would've bet that I'd pick a
fight with a god one day..."
"Brace yourselves, everyone! We're
going all-out until this is settled!"
"Gah, it's barely moved a muscle and
still it's hammerin' us with all sorts
o' shit!"
I can't read its moves!
"We can't dodge its attacks like this...
Oracle, is there anything you can do?"
"Just a sec—analysis in progress!
You'll have to hang in there a bit
longer, sorry!"
Yes! Attack patterns are analyzed!
"Follow my instructions and you'll
be able to dodge enemy attacks!"
"Flanking attack! Fall back, quick!"
Frontal assault! Try dodging them!
"These'll track you down! Keep
running, try to shake 'em!"
"That entire platform's about to be
toast! Can you make it to the next
area over!?"
"Crap—surrounded! Beat those wings
back open!"
"Discard your Desires. Allow me to
grant you all the answers you need."
"Now is the time for you to be freed
from suffering."
"Tch, it's still so unbothered..."
"But it's not as if our attacks are
wholly ineffective. If we keep up
the pressure, we can still win this!"
"Lost ones, why do you resist
salvation? Your Desires bring
you only pain."
"As if lobotomizing all of humanity is
any sort of salvation! "
"Keep that kind of saving for yourself.
It's not happening on our watch!"
"It's working! We just need one last
push..."
"I'm not a heartless doll, I have my
own will! Mine and mine alone!"
"Just like this fatal error you've taken
under your wing, your hubris shall
be your downfall."
You are living proof that I must guide humanity to the Promised Land.
*gasp* *pant* Did we do it!?
"This is fruitless. I cannot discern the
purpose of this conflict."
"Dammit, it's still actin' all cool and
shit... It's really pissin' me off!"
"If you still cannot comprehend the
truth, then the knowledge shall
come at the cost of your very lives."
Something's wrong...
"Indeed, there is a problem. Could
our attacks be lacking any effect?"
"Maybe it's invincible now that it's
a god!? Like... no way, right!?"
"Maybe it has something to do with
the change in form? Lemme analyze
it, hang on!"
"Analysis complete—you gotta hear
this!"
"Time to show you what REAL human
strength is—we're gonna mess you
up!"
"Let's kick some ass, Joker!"
"You never should've messed with
humanity. Hope you're ready to
pay the price!"
"It's go time, Joker!"
"As long as we're around, you're not
getting your way!"
"Let's do this, Joker!"
"A world without freedom can never
know beauty. I shall turn you to
ribbons along with your scheme!"
"The time has come to end this,
Joker!"
"My will is my own, and no one else's!
I won't let anyone tell me how to
live!"
"Let's finish this, Joker!"
"I can take on anyone with my friends
at my side—that even includes a god!"
"Let's go, Joker!"
"I refuse to allow all of humanity to
be turned into dolls. My job is to
stop you!"
"Let's put an end to this, Joker!"
"Since it's impossible to arrest a god,
the Phantom Thieves get to punish
you instead."
"C'mon, let's get 'em, Joker!"
"Wha— Wha!? A warden!? How did
that get here? Did that sphere called
Keter summon it!?"
"Take out Keter first! You'll be
in deep if it keeps summoning
wardens!"
"You see that!? Even a god's no prob
for us!"
"You got it from here, Joker!"
"You're going down! Your luck ran
out the moment you underestimated
the Phantom Thieves!"
"Go for the big finish, Joker!"
"Too late for you to beg for
forgiveness—get lost!"
"Finish it with a bang, Joker!"
"I tire of your grotesque sight...
At least your end can be beautiful!"
"Yes, Joker! Give us the final touch!"
"This is the price for trampling on the
hearts of all humanity!"
Joker! We believe in you!
"We will stand our ground and fight
for ourselves. A phony god like you
won't stop us!"
"It's all yours now, Joker!"
"Your ultimate solution is built
on faulty logic. We can't lose to
someone like you!"
"Go, Joker!"
"That takes care of that. Looks like
this high-and-mighty program's
not so tough after all."
"The rest is yours, Joker!"
"Wipe away these obstacles, Malkhut.
Create the foundation for the ideal
world."
"Damn, a ton of Shadows just
appeared! Looks like Malkhut
can summon them!"
"Man is a fatally flawed organism.
The proof lies in their legacy of
irrational decisions."
"Why would you oppose the creation
of a perfect world? It would be the
best solution for every one of you."
"Not having a place to belong sucks,
but if you don't got one, you just
hafta make one for yourself!"
"That's what these guys taught me.
It's how I know I don't need your
shitty world!"
"As mankind searches for its own
solution, it repeatedly strays from
the correct path."
"By accepting the answers I provide,
you will all be freed of the pain that
accompanies failure."
"That's not how it works at all! There
are all sorts of things to gain while
looking for your answer."
"The memories I share with these
guys would be impossible to make
in your world!"
"Do you truly understand your
actions?"
"Hear me when I say I have formed
the ultimate solution. Humanity
will be delivered from its suffering."
"We're not saying we want to suffer!
Humans hate to endure suffering and
grief..."
"But I know there are amazing things on
the other side of that pain and grief!
And I want to find them for myself!"
"Desires are nothing but evil
temptations, leading humans
down a path of suffering."
"Entrust your Desires to me—or do
you prefer to languish in despair?"
"Despair instills no fear in me. As long
as I have the will to stand once more,
I shall forge my own path!"
"My companions are the ones who
led me to that realization—as if you
could ever comprehend that!"
"Humanity shrinks from difficult
decisions and grows exhausted
by endless possibilities."
"I shall be the end to that suffering.
Are you not in search of such an
answer as well?"
"Fearing repercussions, accepting any
answer foisted on me? I am not that
""good girl"" anymore."
"I won't give up who I am just to
please someone else. I am fighting
to live my life for myself!"
"Deceit... Arrogance... Jealousy...
The world is full of such malice
in its current state."
"The Promised Land is a place of
equality and righteousness. True
peace will be realized there."
"I would love to live in a world where
people don't get hurt..."
"But we have to make that world for
ourselves if we're going to have a
chance! It can't be forced on us!"
"Flawed prototype: you are unable
to provide humanity the correct
answer."
"However, you still have the chance
to correct this. Discard your heart
and join me in the promised land."
"You are not the one who determines
whether or not I have the answer!"
"I'll keep searching for the right
answer myself, no matter how
long it takes!"
"I do not comprehend why you deny
my answer. I can guide you to the
Promised Land. I can save all of you."
"There will be no loss, no grief...
yet you continue to resist?"
"Loss is scary, especially to a coward
like me, and it only gets scarier once
you lose someone important..."
"But what's even scarier is just giving
up! Then I wouldn't be able to
protect the people I still have left!"
"I shall grant you foolish obstructors
the gift of eternal slumber."
"Energy levels are going through the
roof! It's about to wallop you guys!
Run for it!"
"To think you would turn your blades
against a benevolent god..."
"It's recoiling! Now's your chance to
attack!"
"Why...? Desires are the root of all
suffering. Unfathomable...
Unfathomable!"
"You're doing it! Just one more big
push to go—hang in there!"
"Chokmah, grant them my divine
revelation."
"Watch out, Chokmah has multiple
affinity attacks! Don't go ignoring
your weaknesses!"
"Binah, silence these ignorant
transgressors."
"Looks like Binah inflicts status
ailments. Make sure you heal
often!"
"Chesed, bless them with god's
beneficence."
Chesed's healing the rest of them!
"Gevurah, let the proclamation ring
out: fear god or face divine wrath."
"Gevurah can force weaknesses
onto you! Make sure you don't
get knocked down!"
"Tiferet, protect the Promised Land."
"Looks like Tiferet is boosting the
enemy's defenses... We should take
that one down as soon as possible!"
"Netzach, claim our rightful triumph."
"Look out, Netzach can charge you—
just dodge and counterattack!"
"Hod, demonstrate god's glory for
the unbelievers."
"Crap, crap, crap! That Hod is BAD
news! It has a super-scary move!"
"Yesod, purify these humans tainted
with ruinous Desires."
"Looks like Yesod uses [1B]M0~8~Bless
and [1B]M0~9~Curse attacks—steer
clear if you're weak to those!"
"The spheres are dropping one by
one. We're halfway there now!
Keep it up, guys!"
"Desires... Humanity's... Desires...
Unfathomable... Unfathomable..."
"The enemy's down! It's weakened,
too—now's our chance!"
"All right, everybody together!
Let's finish this for good!"
"So, if we mess up the server, won't
that shut down EMMA, or whatever
that god is?"
"But EMMA is still active despite the
server already being shut down
once before."
"Not only that, but we don't know
how destroying the server could
affect all the people..."
"Seems like the safest thing to do
with that room for now is ignore
it. Let's keep climbing."
"My dear, lost, suffering flock... I have
come to provide you the ultimate
solution to your troubles..."
All you must do is follow the path...
One sphere down!

"The Desires of mankind are the root
of their misfortune. Bring this to light
for them, Keter."
"Personally, I'd never call such a 
dreary abomination ""artistic."""
EMMA has all the answers...
"I need EMMA... I can't
live without EMMA..."
"EMMA is the reason
I'm still alive..."
"Someone, guide me..."
Hard work never pays off...
I don't just know anymore...
"The sphere's down! Now you can
really lay into that Demiurge!"
"Something's keeping me
from proceeding... What
am I supposed to do now?"
Ask EMMA
Carve my own path
I should obey EMMA...
"I have to get through this.
I should be able to force
my way through if I try..."
"Once we get on this, there's no turning back.
It'll be the final battle."
"I'm absolutely certain every one of the
Phantom Thieves will need to pull their
weight in this one."
"Whether they're on the frontline or they're
backup, everybody needs to be prepared."
"With all that said, do you think we're ready,
Joker?"
"Yep, let's go."
Not yet.
"All right, let's do it!"
"Okay, just make sure you've done everything
you can for the team."
"We could even take a checkpoint back to
the hideout if you think we really need to
regroup."

"Be careful, guys! This one's really tough!"
"So uhh... My stomach just growled.
You think the Shadows could hear?"
"Remember how we used to go
tearin' through Palaces together?
Ahh... Good times."
"Here we go again... Good thing we've
got Joker on our side!"
"Man, it's times like these I know I'm
supposed to be a Phantom Thief."
"Let's get something sweet after this!
I think we deserve a little reward, 
yeah?"
"Oh! I just remembered...
Hey, Joker, did you already
finish your homework?"
"These Jails certainly have an appeal 
unlike that of a Palace. Should things 
settle down, I'd love to paint one."
"Hm!? This composition... This would
make for an excellent painting!"
"I wonder if these Jails are bigger than
Palaces... Bet it'd be nice to cruise
around here on Johanna."
"Just to make sure, is everyone ready
and alert? We need to be prepared
for whatever comes our way."
"I feel like we're always going up and
down in these Jails. It must be pretty
difficult to remember the layout."
"Hm, this axe is super easy to swing.
I guess all that firewood-chopping 
really paid off."
"Dang, these Jails are humongous.
Be sure to check your map every
now and then."
"What's with this place's layout? Just
reading the map makes my head hurt."
Hmm♪ Hmm♪
"Hey, everyone, would you say I'm
useful? I really hope so."
"Never in my life did I imagine
becoming a phantom thief.
What would Akane say about this?"
"You know, I just have to put it out
there. This outfit? It's freakin' badass."

It seems it won't open...
I should obey EMMA...
"I'll be mocked
if I go this way..."
"It'd be best to do what
everyone else does..."
"I should follow the
path laid out for me..."
**怜喧縺代ヱ繧*繝*繝*
It looks delicious...
"It seems we can't
go through here..."
"I should take a good
look around first..."
"It's the tape recorder
with the record of what
transpired in this lab..."
"It's a fox statue so detailed,
it looks like it could move on
its own any moment now..."
"We can't cross the drawbridge
while it's raised like this..."
"We can't go any further with
this ice wall in our way..."
